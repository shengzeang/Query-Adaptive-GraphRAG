{"Question": "The __________ component of tf-idf decreases the weight of common terms across multiple documents.", "Level-1 Topic": "Information retrieval", "Level-2 Topic": "Tf\u2013idf", "Rationale": "Inverse document frequency reduces the impact of terms that appear frequently across many documents, highlighting more unique and relevant terms in the context of a query.", "Answer": "inverse document frequency"}
{"Question": "An inverted index maps terms to __________ identifiers, enabling efficient document retrieval.", "Level-1 Topic": "Information retrieval", "Level-2 Topic": "Inverted index", "Rationale": "An inverted index connects terms with their corresponding document identifiers, streamlining the search process by allowing quick access to relevant documents based on specific search terms.", "Answer": "document"}
{"Question": "The primary benefit of using an inverted index is its ability to increase __________ speed during search queries.", "Level-1 Topic": "Information retrieval", "Level-2 Topic": "Inverted index", "Rationale": "An inverted index significantly enhances retrieval speed by organizing term-document relationships effectively, allowing for rapid access to documents containing specific terms.", "Answer": "retrieval"}
{"Question": "Maintaining an inverted index requires regular __________ to reflect changes in documents and user data.", "Level-1 Topic": "Information retrieval", "Level-2 Topic": "Inverted index", "Rationale": "Frequent updates are essential for an inverted index to ensure it accurately represents the latest content, maintaining its effectiveness in retrieving relevant documents.", "Answer": "updates"}
