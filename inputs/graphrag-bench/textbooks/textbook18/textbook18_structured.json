        "content": "Getting Started with Python \nOne of the friendly things about Python is that it allows you to type directly into the interactive interpreter—the program that will be running your Python programs. You can access the Python interpreter using a simple graphical interface called the Interactive DeveLopment Environment (IDLE). On a Mac you can find this under Applications $$ MacPython, and on Windows under All Programs $$ Python. Under Unix you can run Python from the shell by typing idle (if this is not installed, try typing python). The interpreter will print a blurb about your Python version; simply check that you are running Python 2.4 or 2.5 (here it is 2.5.1): \nPython 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Apr 15 2008, 22:57:26)   \n[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)] on darwin   \nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information. >>> \nIf you are unable to run the Python interpreter, you probably don’t have Python installed correctly. Please visit http://python.org/ for detailed instructions. \nThe $gg gg$ prompt indicates that the Python interpreter is now waiting for input. When copying examples from this book, don’t type the “>>>” yourself. Now, let’s begin by using Python as a calculator: \nOnce the interpreter has finished calculating the answer and displaying it, the prompt reappears. This means the Python interpreter is waiting for another instruction. \nYour Turn: Enter a few more expressions of your own. You can use asterisk $( { } ^ { * } )$ for multiplication and slash $( / )$ for division, and parentheses for bracketing expressions. Note that division doesn’t always behave as you might expect—it does integer division (with rounding of fractions downwards) when you type $_ { 1 / 3 }$ and “floating-point” (or decimal) division when you type $phantom { + } 1 . 0 / 3 . 0$ . In order to get the expected behavior of division (standard in Python 3.0), you need to type: from __future__ import division. \nThe preceding examples demonstrate how you can work interactively with the Python interpreter, experimenting with various expressions in the language to see what they do. Now let’s try a non-sensical expression to see how the interpreter handles it: \n>>> 1 + File \"<stdin>\", line 1 1 + A   \nSyntaxError: invalid syntax   \n>>> \nThis produced a syntax error. In Python, it doesn’t make sense to end an instruction with a plus sign. The Python interpreter indicates the line where the problem occurred (line 1 of <stdin>, which stands for “standard input”). \nNow that we can use the Python interpreter, we’re ready to start working with language data. \nGetting Started with NLTK \nBefore going further you should install NLTK, downloadable for free from http://www .nltk.org/. Follow the instructions there to download the version required for your platform. \nOnce you’ve installed NLTK, start up the Python interpreter as before, and install the data required for the book by typing the following two commands at the Python prompt, then selecting the book collection as shown in Figure 1-1. \n>>> import nltk>>> nltk.download()\nOnce the data is downloaded to your machine, you can load some of it using the Python interpreter. The first step is to type a special command at the Python prompt, which tells the interpreter to load some texts for us to explore: from nltk.book import *. This says “from NLTK’s book module, load all items.” The book module contains all the data you will need as you read this chapter. After printing a welcome message, it loads the text of several books (this will take a few seconds). Here’s the command again, together with the output that you will see.

You can also try searches on some of the other texts we have included. For example, search Sense and Sensibility for the word affection, using text2.concord ance(\"affection\"). Search the book of Genesis to find out how long some people lived, using: text3.concordance(\"lived\"). You could look at text4, the Inaugural Address Corpus, to see examples of English going back to 1789, and search for words like nation, terror, god to see how these words have been used differently over time. We’ve also included text5, the NPS Chat Corpus: search this for unconventional words like im, ur, lol. (Note that this corpus is uncensored!) \nOnce you’ve spent a little while examining these texts, we hope you have a new sense of the richness and diversity of language. In the next chapter you will learn how to access a broader range of text, including text in languages other than English. \nA concordance permits us to see words in context. For example, we saw that monstrous occurred in contexts such as the ___ pictures and the ___ size. What other words appear in a similar range of contexts? We can find out by appending the term similar to the name of the text in question, then inserting the relevant word in parentheses: \n>>> text1.similar(\"monstrous\")   \nBuilding word-context index...   \nsubtly impalpable pitiable curious imperial perilous trustworthy abundant untoward singular lamentable few maddens horrible loving lazy mystifying christian exasperate puzzled   \n>>> text2.similar(\"monstrous\")   \nBuilding word-context index...   \nvery exceedingly so heartily a great good amazingly as sweet   \nremarkably extremely vast   \n>>> \nObserve that we get different results for different texts. Austen uses this word quite differently from Melville; for her, monstrous has positive connotations, and sometimes functions as an intensifier like the word very. \nThe term common_contexts allows us to examine just the contexts that are shared by two or more words, such as monstrous and very. We have to enclose these words by square brackets as well as parentheses, and separate them with a comma: \n>>> text2.common_contexts([\"monstrous\", \"very\"]) be_glad am_glad a_pretty is_pretty a_lucky >>> \nYour Turn: Pick another pair of words and compare their usage in two different texts, using the similar() and common_contexts() functions. \nIt is one thing to automatically detect that a particular word occurs in a text, and to display some words that appear in the same context. However, we can also determine the location of a word in the text: how many words from the beginning it appears. This positional information can be displayed using a dispersion plot. Each stripe represents an instance of a word, and each row represents the entire text. In Figure 1-2 we see some striking patterns of word usage over the last 220 years (in an artificial text constructed by joining the texts of the Inaugural Address Corpus end-to-end). You can produce this plot as shown below. You might like to try more words (e.g., liberty, constitution) and different texts. Can you predict the dispersion of a word before you view it? As before, take care to get the quotes, commas, brackets, and parentheses exactly right. \n>>> text4.dispersion_plot([\"citizens\", \"democracy\", \"freedom\", \"duties\", \"America\"]) >>> \nImportant: You need to have Python’s NumPy and Matplotlib packages installed in order to produce the graphical plots used in this book. Please see http://www.nltk.org/ for installation instructions. \nNow, just for fun, let’s try generating some random text in the various styles we have just seen. To do this, we type the name of the text followed by the term generate. (We need to include the parentheses, but there’s nothing that goes between them.) \n>>> text3.generate()   \nIn the beginning of his brother is a hairy man , whose top may reach unto heaven ; and ye shall sow the land of Egypt there was no bread in all that he was taken out of the month , upon the earth . So shall thy wages be ? And they made their father ; and Isaac was old , and kissed him : and Laban with his cattle in the midst of the hands of Esau thy first born , and Phichol the chief butler unto his son Isaac , she >>> \nNote that the first time you run this command, it is slow because it gathers statistics about word sequences. Each time you run it, you will get different output text. Now try generating random text in the style of an inaugural address or an Internet chat room. Although the text is random, it reuses common words and phrases from the source text and gives us a sense of its style and content. (What is lacking in this randomly generated text?) \nWhen generate produces its output, punctuation is split off from the preceding word. While this is not correct formatting for English text, we do it to make clear that words and punctuation are independent of one another. You will learn more about this in Chapter 3. \nCounting Vocabulary \nThe most obvious fact about texts that emerges from the preceding examples is that they differ in the vocabulary they use. In this section, we will see how to use the computer to count the words in a text in a variety of useful ways. As before, you will jump right in and experiment with the Python interpreter, even though you may not have studied Python systematically yet. Test your understanding by modifying the examples, and trying the exercises at the end of the chapter. \nLet’s begin by finding out the length of a text from start to finish, in terms of the words and punctuation symbols that appear. We use the term len to get the length of something, which we’ll apply here to the book of Genesis: \n>>> len(text3)   \n44764   \n>>> \nSo Genesis has 44,764 words and punctuation symbols, or “tokens.” A token is the technical name for a sequence of characters—such as hairy, his, or :)—that we want to treat as a group. When we count the number of tokens in a text, say, the phrase to be or not to be, we are counting occurrences of these sequences. Thus, in our example phrase there are two occurrences of to, two of be, and one each of or and not. But there are only four distinct vocabulary items in this phrase. How many distinct words does the book of Genesis contain? To work this out in Python, we have to pose the question slightly differently. The vocabulary of a text is just the set of tokens that it uses, since in a set, all duplicates are collapsed together. In Python we can obtain the vocabulary items of text3 with the command: set(text3). When you do this, many screens of words will fly past. Now try the following:",

We use the term len to get the length of something, which we’ll apply here to the book of Genesis: \n>>> len(text3)   \n44764   \n>>> \nSo Genesis has 44,764 words and punctuation symbols, or “tokens.” A token is the technical name for a sequence of characters—such as hairy, his, or :)—that we want to treat as a group. When we count the number of tokens in a text, say, the phrase to be or not to be, we are counting occurrences of these sequences. Thus, in our example phrase there are two occurrences of to, two of be, and one each of or and not. But there are only four distinct vocabulary items in this phrase. How many distinct words does the book of Genesis contain? To work this out in Python, we have to pose the question slightly differently. The vocabulary of a text is just the set of tokens that it uses, since in a set, all duplicates are collapsed together. In Python we can obtain the vocabulary items of text3 with the command: set(text3). When you do this, many screens of words will fly past. Now try the following: \n\n>>> sorted(set(text3))   \n['!' '?' , '?)',   \n'A', 'Abel', 'Abelmizraim Abidah Abide' 'Abimael', 'Abimelech',   \n'Abr', 'Abrah', 'Abraham', 'Abram', 'Accad', 'Achbor', 'Adah', ...]   \n>>> len(set(text3))   \n2789   \n>>> \nBy wrapping sorted() around the Python expression set(text3) , we obtain a sorted list of vocabulary items, beginning with various punctuation symbols and continuing with words starting with A. All capitalized words precede lowercase words. We discover the size of the vocabulary indirectly, by asking for the number of items in the set, and again we can use len to obtain this number $pmb { theta }$ . Although it has 44,764 tokens, this book has only 2,789 distinct words, or “word types.” A word type is the form or spelling of the word independently of its specific occurrences in a text—that is, the word considered as a unique item of vocabulary. Our count of 2,789 items will include punctuation symbols, so we will generally call these unique items types instead of word types. \nNow, let’s calculate a measure of the lexical richness of the text. The next example shows us that each word is used 16 times on average (we need to make sure Python uses floating-point division): \n>>> from __future__ import division   \n>>> len(text3) / len(set(text3))   \n16.050197203298673   \n>>> \nNext, let’s focus on particular words. We can count how often a word occurs in a text, and compute what percentage of the text is taken up by a specific word: \n>>> text3.count(\"smote\")   \n5   \n>>> 100 * text4.count('a') / len(text4)   \n1.4643016433938312   \n>>> \nYour Turn: How many times does the word lol appear in text5? How much is this as a percentage of the total number of words in this text? \nYou may want to repeat such calculations on several texts, but it is tedious to keep retyping the formula. Instead, you can come up with your own name for a task, like “lexical_diversity” or “percentage”, and associate it with a block of code. Now you only have to type a short name instead of one or more complete lines of Python code, and you can reuse it as often as you like. The block of code that does a task for us is called a function, and we define a short name for our function with the keyword def. The next example shows how to define two new functions, lexical_diversity() and percentage(): \n\n>>> def lexical_diversity(text): return len(text) / len(set(text))   \n>>> def percentage(count, total): return 100 * count / total \nCaution! \nThe Python interpreter changes the prompt from >>> to ... after encountering the colon at the end of the first line. The ... prompt indicates that Python expects an indented code block to appear next. It is up to you to do the indentation, by typing four spaces or hitting the Tab key. To finish the indented block, just enter a blank line. \nIn the definition of lexical diversity() $bullet$ , we specify a parameter labeled text. This parameter is a “placeholder” for the actual text whose lexical diversity we want to compute, and reoccurs in the block of code that will run when the function is used, in line . Similarly, percentage() is defined to take two parameters, labeled count and total . \nOnce Python knows that lexical_diversity() and percentage() are the names for specific blocks of code, we can go ahead and use these functions: \n>>> lexical_diversity(text3)   \n16.050197203298673   \n>>> lexical_diversity(text5)   \n7.4200461589185629   \n>>> percentage(4, 5)   \n80.0   \n>>> percentage(text4.count('a'), len(text4))   \n1.4643016433938312   \n>>> \nTo recap, we use or call a function such as lexical_diversity() by typing its name, followed by an open parenthesis, the name of the text, and then a close parenthesis. These parentheses will show up often; their role is to separate the name of a task—such as lexical_diversity()—from the data that the task is to be performed on—such as text3. The data value that we place in the parentheses when we call a function is an argument to the function. \nYou have already encountered several functions in this chapter, such as len(), set(), and sorted(). By convention, we will always add an empty pair of parentheses after a function name, as in len(), just to make clear that what we are talking about is a function rather than some other kind of Python expression. Functions are an important concept in programming, and we only mention them at the outset to give newcomers a sense of the power and creativity of programming. Don’t worry if you find it a bit confusing right now. \n\nLater we’ll see how to use functions when tabulating data, as in Table 1-1. Each row of the table will involve the same computation but with different data, and we’ll do this repetitive work using a function. \n1.2  A Closer Look at Python: Texts as Lists of Words \nYou’ve seen some important elements of the Python programming language. Let’s take a few moments to review them systematically. \nLists \nWhat is a text? At one level, it is a sequence of symbols on a page such as this one. At another level, it is a sequence of chapters, made up of a sequence of sections, where each section is a sequence of paragraphs, and so on. However, for our purposes, we will think of a text as nothing more than a sequence of words and punctuation. Here’s how we represent text in Python, in this case the opening sentence of Moby Dick: \n>>> sent1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.'] >>> \nAfter the prompt we’ve given a name we made up, sent1, followed by the equals sign, and then some quoted words, separated with commas, and surrounded with brackets. This bracketed material is known as a list in Python: it is how we store a text. We can inspect it by typing the name $bullet$ . We can ask for its length $pmb { theta }$ . We can even apply our own lexical_diversity() function to it $bullet$ . \n>>> sent1   \n['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.']   \n>>> len(sent1)   \n4   \n>>> lexical_diversity(sent1)   \n1.0   \n>>>",

We inspect two of them here; you can see the rest for yourself using the Python interpreter (if you get an error saying that sent2 is not defined, you need to first type from nltk.book import *). \n>>> sent2   \n['The', 'family', 'of', 'Dashwood', 'had', 'long',   \n'been', 'settled', 'in', 'Sussex', .']   \n>>> sent3   \n['In', 'the', 'beginning', 'God', 'created', 'the',   \n'heaven', 'and', 'the', 'earth', '.']   \n>>> \nYour Turn: Make up a few sentences of your own, by typing a name, equals sign, and a list of words, like this: ex1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Monty', 'Python', 'and', 'the', 'Holy', 'Grail']. Repeat some of the other Python operations we saw earlier in Section 1.1, e.g., sorted(ex1), len(set(ex1)), ex1.count('the'). \nA pleasant surprise is that we can use Python’s addition operator on lists. Adding two lists $bullet$ creates a new list with everything from the first list, followed by everything from the second list: \n>>> ['Monty', 'Python'] + ['and', 'the', 'Holy', 'Grail'] ['Monty', 'Python', 'and', 'the', 'Holy', 'Grail'] \nThis special use of the addition operation is called concatenation; it combines the lists together into a single list. We can concatenate sentences to build up a text. \nWe don’t have to literally type the lists either; we can use short names that refer to predefined lists. \n>>> sent4 $^ +$ sent1   \n['Fellow', '-' 'Citizens', 'of', 'the', 'Senate', 'and', 'of', 'the', 'House', 'of', 'Representatives', ':', 'Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.'] >>> \nWhat if we want to add a single item to a list? This is known as appending. When we append() to a list, the list itself is updated as a result of the operation. \n>>> sent1.append(\"Some\")   \n>>> sent1   \n['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.', 'Some']   \n>>> \nIndexing Lists \nAs we have seen, a text in Python is a list of words, represented using a combination of brackets and quotes.

        "content": "Indexing Lists \nAs we have seen, a text in Python is a list of words, represented using a combination of brackets and quotes. Just as with an ordinary page of text, we can count up the total number of words in text1 with len(text1), and count the occurrences in a text of a particular word—say, heaven—using text1.count('heaven'). \nWith some patience, we can pick out the 1st, 173rd, or even 14,278th word in a printed text.

The reason is simple: the moment Python accesses the content of a list from the computer’s memory, it is already at the first element; we have to tell it how many elements forward to go. Thus, zero steps forward leaves it at the first element. \nThis practice of counting from zero is initially confusing, but typical of modern programming languages. You’ll quickly get the hang of it if you’ve mastered the system of counting centuries where 19XY is a year in the $2 0 mathrm { { t h } }$ century, or if you live in a country where the floors of a building are numbered from 1, and so walking up $n$ -1 flights of stairs takes you to level $n$ . \nNow, if we accidentally use an index that is too large, we get an error: \n>>> sent[10]   \nTraceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in ?   \nIndexError: list index out of range   \n>>> \nThis time it is not a syntax error, because the program fragment is syntactically correct. Instead, it is a runtime error, and it produces a Traceback message that shows the context of the error, followed by the name of the error, IndexError, and a brief explanation. \nLet’s take a closer look at slicing, using our artificial sentence again. Here we verify that the slice 5:8 includes sent elements at indexes 5, 6, and 7: \n>>> sent[5:8]   \n['word6', 'word7', 'word8']   \n>>> sent[5]   \n'word6'   \n>>> sent[6]   \n'word7'   \n>>> sent[7]   \n'word8'   \n>>> \nBy convention, m:n means elements m…n-1. As the next example shows, we can omit the first number if the slice begins at the start of the list $bullet$ , and we can omit the second number if the slice goes to the end $pmb { theta }$ : \n>>> sent[:3]   \n['word1', 'word2', 'word3']   \n>>> text2[141525:]   \n['among', 'the', 'merits', 'and', 'the', 'happiness', 'of', 'Elinor', 'and', 'Marianne',   \n',', 'let', 'it', 'not', 'be', 'ranked', 'as', 'the', 'least', 'considerable', ',',   \n'that', 'though', 'sisters', 'and', 'living', 'almost', 'within', 'sight', 'of',   \n'each', 'other 'they 'could', 'live', 'without', 'disagreement', 'between',   \n'themselves', or' 'producing', 'coolness', 'between', 'their', 'husbands',   \n'THE', 'END']   \n>>> \nWe can modify an element of a list by assigning to one of its index values. In the next example, we put sent[0] on the left of the equals sign $bullet$ . We can also replace an entire slice with new material . A consequence of this last change is that the list only has four elements, and accessing a later value generates an error $bullet$ . \n>>> sent[0] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'First'   \n>>> sent[9] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Last'   \n>>> len(sent)   \n10   \n>>> sent[1:9] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Second', 'Third']   \n>>> sent   \n['First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Last']   \n>>> sent[9] $bullet$   \nTraceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in ?   \nIndexError: list index out of range   \n>>> \nYour Turn: Take a few minutes to define a sentence of your own and modify individual words and groups of words (slices) using the same methods used earlier. Check your understanding by trying the exercises on lists at the end of this chapter. \nVariables \nFrom the start of Section 1.1, you have had access to texts called text1, text2, and so on. It saved a lot of typing to be able to refer to a 250,000-word book with a short name like this! In general, we can make up names for anything we care to calculate. We did this ourselves in the previous sections, e.g., defining a variable sent1, as follows: \n>>> sent1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.'] >>> \nSuch lines have the form: variable $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ expression. Python will evaluate the expression, and save its result to the variable. This process is called assignment. It does not generate any output; you have to type the variable on a line of its own to inspect its contents. The equals sign is slightly misleading, since information is moving from the right side to the left. It might help to think of it as a left-arrow. The name of the variable can be anything you like, e.g., my_sent, sentence, xyzzy. It must start with a letter, and can include numbers and underscores. Here are some examples of variables and assignments: \n>>> my_sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Bravely', 'bold', 'Sir', 'Robin', ',', 'rode', 'forth', 'from', 'Camelot', ']   \n>>> noun_phrase $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ my_sent[1:4]   \n>>> noun_phrase   \n['bold', 'Sir', 'Robin']   \n>>> wOrDs $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ sorted(noun_phrase)   \n>>> wOrDs   \n['Robin', 'Sir', 'bold']   \n>>> \nRemember that capitalized words appear before lowercase words in sorted lists.",

We began this discussion in Section 1.1, and saw how to search for words in context, how to compile the vocabulary of a text, how to generate random text in the same style, and so on. \nIn this section, we pick up the question of what makes a text distinct, and use automatic methods to find characteristic words and expressions of a text. As in Section 1.1, you can try new features of the Python language by copying them into the interpreter, and you’ll learn about these features systematically in the following section. \nBefore continuing further, you might like to check your understanding of the last section by predicting the output of the following code.

        "content": "Frequency Distributions \nHow can we automatically identify the words of a text that are most informative about the topic and genre of the text? Imagine how you might go about finding the $5 0 mathrm { m o s t }$ frequent words of a book. One method would be to keep a tally for each vocabulary item, like that shown in Figure 1-3. The tally would need thousands of rows, and it would be an exceedingly laborious process—so laborious that we would rather assign the task to a machine. \nThe table in Figure 1-3 is known as a frequency distribution , and it tells us the frequency of each vocabulary item in the text. (In general, it could count any kind of observable event.) It is a “distribution” since it tells us how the total number of word tokens in the text are distributed across the vocabulary items. Since we often need frequency distributions in language processing, NLTK provides built-in support for them. Let’s use a FreqDist to find the 50 most frequent words of Moby Dick. Try to work out what is going on here, then read the explanation that follows. \n>>> fdist1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ FreqDist(text1)   \n>>> fdist1   \n<FreqDist with 260819 outcomes>   \n>>> vocabulary1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ fdist1.keys()   \n>>> vocabulary1[:50] 'the' 'of', 'and', 'to', 'in', 'that', 11   \n[', a'   \n'his', 'it', 'he with was', as 1 all for   \n'this', '!', 'at', 'by', 'but', 'not', 'him' 'from', 'be', on'   \n'so', 'whale', 'one', you', 'had', 'have', 'there', 'But', 'or', 'were',   \n'now', 'which', '?', 'me', 'like']   \n>>> fdist1['whale']   \n906   \n>>> \nWhen we first invoke FreqDist, we pass the name of the text as an argument $bullet$ . We can inspect the total number of words (“outcomes”) that have been counted up $bullet$ — 260,819 in the case of Moby Dick. The expression keys() gives us a list of all the distinct types in the text $bullet$ , and we can look at the first 50 of these by slicing the list $bullet$ . \nYour Turn: Try the preceding frequency distribution example for yourself, for text2. Be careful to use the correct parentheses and uppercase letters. If you get an error message NameError: name 'FreqDist' is not defined, you need to start your work with from nltk.book import *. \nDo any words produced in the last example help us grasp the topic or genre of this text? Only one word, whale, is slightly informative! It occurs over 900 times. The rest of the words tell us nothing about the text; they’re just English “plumbing.” What proportion of the text is taken up with such words? We can generate a cumulative frequency plot for these words, using fdist1.plot(50, cumulative $ c =$ True), to produce the graph in Figure 1-4. These 50 words account for nearly half the book! \nIf the frequent words don’t help us, how about the words that occur once only, the socalled hapaxes? View them by typing fdist1.hapaxes(). This list contains lexicographer, cetological, contraband, expostulations, and about 9,000 others. It seems that there are too many rare words, and without seeing the context we probably can’t guess what half of the hapaxes mean in any case! Since neither frequent nor infrequent words help, we need to try something else. \nFine-Grained Selection of Words \nNext, let’s look at the long words of a text; perhaps these will be more characteristic and informative. For this we adapt some notation from set theory. We would like to find the words from the vocabulary of the text that are more than 15 characters long. Let’s call this property $P$ , so that $P ( w )$ is true if and only if $boldsymbol { w }$ is more than 15 characters long. Now we can express the words of interest using mathematical set notation as shown in (1a). This means “the set of all $boldsymbol { w }$ such that $boldsymbol { w }$ is an element of $V$ (the vocabulary) and $boldsymbol { w }$ has property $P$ .” \n(1) $begin{array} { r l } & { mathrm { a . ~ } left{ w mid w in V & P ( w ) right} }  & { mathrm { b . ~ } left[ mathsf { w  F o r  w i n  v i f  p } ( w ) right] } end{array}$ \nThe corresponding Python expression is given in (1b). (Note that it produces a list, not a set, which means that duplicates are possible.) Observe how similar the two notations are. Let’s go one more step and write executable Python code: \n>>> V = set(text1)   \n>>> long_words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [w for $w$ in V if len(w) > 15]   \n>>> sorted(long_words)   \n['CIRCUMNAVIGATION', 'Physiognomically', 'apprehensiveness', 'cannibalistically',   \n'characteristically' 'circumnavigating', 'circumnavigation', 'circumnavigations'   \n'comprehensiveness', 'hermaphroditical', 'indiscriminately', 'indispensableness',   \n'irresistibleness', 'physiognomically', 'preternaturalness', 'responsibilities',   \n'simultaneousness', 'subterraneousness', 'supernaturalness', 'superstitiousness'   \n'uncomfortableness', 'uncompromisedness', 'undiscriminating', 'uninterpenetratingly']   \n>>> \nFor each word w in the vocabulary $mathsf { V }$ , we check whether $mathsf { l e n } ( mathsf { w } )$ is greater than 15; all other words will be ignored. We will discuss this syntax more carefully later. \nYour Turn: Try out the previous statements in the Python interpreter, and experiment with changing the text and changing the length condition. Does it make an difference to your results if you change the variable names, e.g., using [word for word in vocab if ...]?",

Does it make an difference to your results if you change the variable names, e.g., using [word for word in vocab if ...]? \nLet’s return to our task of finding words that characterize a text. Notice that the long words in text4 reflect its national focus—constitutionally, transcontinental—whereas those in text5 reflect its informal content: boooooooooooglyyyyyy and yuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmm. Have we succeeded in automatically extracting words that typify a text? Well, these very long words are often hapaxes (i.e., unique) and perhaps it would be better to find frequently occurring long words.

In order to find red wine as a collocation, we would need to process a much larger body of text. \nCounting Other Things \nCounting words is useful, but we can count other things too. For example, we can look at the distribution of word lengths in a text, by creating a FreqDist out of a long list of numbers, where each number is the length of the corresponding word in the text: \n>>> [len $( mathsf { w } )$ for w in text1]   \n[1, 4, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 1, 9, 1, 1, 8, 2, 1, 4, 11, 5, 2, 1, 7, 6, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, ...]   \n>>> fdist $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ FreqDist([len(w) for $w$ in text1])   \n>>> fdist   \n<FreqDist with 260819 outcomes>   \n>>> fdist.keys()   \n[3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20]   \n>>> \nWe start by deriving a list of the lengths of words in text1 $bullet$ , and the FreqDist then counts the number of times each of these occurs $bullet$ . The result $bullet$ is a distribution containing a quarter of a million items, each of which is a number corresponding to a word token in the text. But there are only 20 distinct items being counted, the numbers 1 through 20, because there are only 20 different word lengths. I.e., there are words consisting of just 1 character, 2 characters, ..., 20 characters, but none with 21 or more characters. One might wonder how frequent the different lengths of words are (e.g., how many words of length 4 appear in the text, are there more words of length 5 than length 4, etc.). We can do this as follows: \n>>> fdist.items()   \n[(3, 50223), (1, 47933), (4, 42345), (2, 38513), (5, 26597), (6, 17111), (7, 14399),   \n(8, 9966), (9, 6428), (10, 3528), (11, 1873), (12, 1053), (13, 567), (14, 177),   \n(15, 70), (16, 22), (17, 12), (18, 1), (20, 1)]   \n>>> fdist.max()   \n3   \n>>> fdist[3]   \n50223   \n>>> fdist.freq(3)   \n0.19255882431878046   \n>>> \nFrom this we see that the most frequent word length is 3, and that words of length 3 account for roughly 50,000 (or $2 0 %$ ) of the words making up the book.

A key feature of programming is the ability of machines to make decisions on our behalf, executing instructions when certain conditions are met, or repeatedly looping through text data until some condition is satisfied. This feature is known as control, and is the focus of this section. \nConditionals \nPython supports a wide range of operators, such as $angle cdot angle$ and $> =$ , for testing the relationship between values. The full set of these relational operators are shown in Table 1-3. \nWe can use these to select different words from a sentence of news text. Here are some examples—notice only the operator is changed from one line to the next. They all use sent7, the first sentence from text7 (Wall Street Journal). As before, if you get an error saying that sent7 is undefined, you need to first type: from nltk.book import *. \nThere is a common pattern to all of these examples: [w for w in text if condition], where condition is a Python “test” that yields either true or false. In the cases shown in the previous code example, the condition is always a numerical comparison. However, we can also test various properties of words, using the functions listed in Table 1-4. \nHere are some examples of these operators being used to select words from our texts: words ending with -ableness; words containing gnt; words having an initial capital; and words consisting entirely of digits. \n>>> sorted([w for w in set(text1) if w.endswith('ableness')])   \n['comfortableness', 'honourableness', 'immutableness', 'indispensableness', ...]   \n>>> sorted([term for term in set(text4) if 'gnt' in term])   \n['Sovereignty', 'sovereignties', 'sovereignty']   \n>>> sorted([item for item in set(text6) if item.istitle()])   \n['A', 'Aaaaaaaaah', 'Aaaaaaaah', 'Aaaaaah', 'Aaaah', 'Aaaaugh', 'Aaagh', ...]   \n>>> sorted([item for item in set(sent7) if item.isdigit()])   \n['29', '61']   \n>>> \nWe can also create more complex conditions. If $c$ is a condition, then not $c$ is also a condition. If we have two conditions $c _ { 1 }$ and $c _ { 2 }$ , then we can combine them to form a new condition using conjunction and disjunction: $c _ { 1 }$ and $c _ { 2 }$ , $boldsymbol { cdot } boldsymbol { c } _ { 1 } circ mathbf { r } boldsymbol { c } _ { 2 }$ . \nYour Turn: Run the following examples and try to explain what is going on in each one. Next, try to make up some conditions of your own. \n>>> sorted([w for $w$ in set(text7) if '-' in w and 'index' in w]) >>> sorted([wd for wd in set(text3) if wd.istitle() and $mathrm { l e n } ( mathsf { w d } )  >  mathsf { 1 0 } bigr ] ,$ ) >>> sorted([w for w in set(sent7) if not w.islower()]) >>> sorted([t for t in set(text2) if 'cie' in t or 'cei' in t]) \nOperating on Every Element \nIn Section 1.3, we saw some examples of counting items other than words. Let’s take a closer look at the notation we used: \n>>> [len(w) for w in text1]   \n[1, 4, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 1, 9, 1, 1, 8, 2, 1, 4, 11, 5, 2, 1, 7, 6, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, ...]   \n>>> [w.upper() for w in text1]   \n['[', 'MOBY', 'DICK', 'BY', 'HERMAN', 'MELVILLE', '1851', ']', 'ETYMOLOGY', '.', ...]   \n>>> \nThese expressions have the form $[ mathsf { f } ( mathsf { w } )$ for ...] or $[ { pmb w } . { dag } ( lambda )  { dag } 0 { bf r } quad . . . ]$ , where $mathsf { f }$ is a function that operates on a word to compute its length, or to convert it to uppercase. For now, you don’t need to understand the difference between the notations $mathsf { f } ( boldsymbol { mathsf { w } } )$ and ${ mathsf w } . { mathsf f } ( )$ . Instead, simply learn this Python idiom which performs the same operation on every element of a list. In the preceding examples, it goes through each word in text1, assigning each one in turn to the variable $w$ and performing the specified operation on the variable. \nThe notation just described is called a “list comprehension.” This is our first example of a Python idiom, a fixed notation that we use habitually without bothering to analyze each time. Mastering such idioms is an important part of becoming a fluent Python programmer. \nLet’s return to the question of vocabulary size, and apply the same idiom here: \n>>> len(text1) 260819",

Perhaps it would have been simpler just to count the lowercase-only items, but this gives the wrong answer (why?). \nDon’t worry if you don’t feel confident with list comprehensions yet, since you’ll see many more examples along with explanations in the following chapters. \nNested Code Blocks \nMost programming languages permit us to execute a block of code when a conditional expression, or if statement, is satisfied. We already saw examples of conditional tests in code like $[ w$ for $w$ in sent7 if $1 mathsf { e n } ( mathsf { w } )  <  4 ]$ . In the following program, we have created a variable called word containing the string value 'cat'. The if statement checks whether the test $mathrm { l e n } ( mathsf { w o r d } )  <  5$ is true. It is, so the body of the if statement is invoked and the print statement is executed, displaying a message to the user. Remember to indent the print statement by typing four spaces. \n>>> word $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'cat'   \n>>> if len(word) < 5: print 'word length is less than 5' 0   \nword length is less than 5   \n>>> \nWhen we use the Python interpreter we have to add an extra blank line $bullet$ in order for it to detect that the nested block is complete. \nIf we change the conditional test to $1 mathsf { e n } ( mathsf { w o r d } )  succ =  5$ , to check that the length of word is greater than or equal to 5, then the test will no longer be true. This time, the body of the if statement will not be executed, and no message is shown to the user: \n>>> if $mathrm { l e n } ( mathsf { w o r d } )  > =  5$ : print 'word length is greater than or equal to 5'   \n>>>",

Remember to indent the print statement by typing four spaces. \n>>> word $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'cat'   \n>>> if len(word) < 5: print 'word length is less than 5' 0   \nword length is less than 5   \n>>> \nWhen we use the Python interpreter we have to add an extra blank line $bullet$ in order for it to detect that the nested block is complete. \nIf we change the conditional test to $1 mathsf { e n } ( mathsf { w o r d } )  succ =  5$ , to check that the length of word is greater than or equal to 5, then the test will no longer be true. This time, the body of the if statement will not be executed, and no message is shown to the user: \n>>> if $mathrm { l e n } ( mathsf { w o r d } )  > =  5$ : print 'word length is greater than or equal to 5'   \n>>> \nAn if statement is known as a control structure because it controls whether the code in the indented block will be run. Another control structure is the for loop. Try the following, and remember to include the colon and the four spaces: \n>>> for word in ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.']: print word   \nCall   \nme   \nIshmael   \n>>> \nThis is called a loop because Python executes the code in circular fashion. It starts by performing the assignment word $begin{array} { r l } { mathbf { Psi } = } & { { } cdot mathsf { C a l l } ^ { mathbf { Psi } } } end{array}$ , effectively using the word variable to name the first item of the list. Then, it displays the value of word to the user. Next, it goes back to the for statement, and performs the assignment word $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'me' before displaying this new value to the user, and so on. It continues in this fashion until every item of the list has been processed. \nLooping with Conditions \nNow we can combine the if and for statements. We will loop over every item of the list, and print the item only if it ends with the letter l. We’ll pick another name for the variable to demonstrate that Python doesn’t try to make sense of variable names. \n>>> sent1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.']   \n>>> for xyzzy in sent1: if xyzzy.endswith('l'): print xyzzy   \nCall   \nIshmael   \n>>> \nYou will notice that if and for statements have a colon at the end of the line, before the indentation begins. In fact, all Python control structures end with a colon.

        "content": "An if statement is known as a control structure because it controls whether the code in the indented block will be run. Another control structure is the for loop. Try the following, and remember to include the colon and the four spaces: \n>>> for word in ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.']: print word   \nCall   \nme   \nIshmael   \n>>> \nThis is called a loop because Python executes the code in circular fashion. It starts by performing the assignment word $begin{array} { r l } { mathbf { Psi } = } & { { } cdot mathsf { C a l l } ^ { mathbf { Psi } } } end{array}$ , effectively using the word variable to name the first item of the list. Then, it displays the value of word to the user. Next, it goes back to the for statement, and performs the assignment word $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'me' before displaying this new value to the user, and so on. It continues in this fashion until every item of the list has been processed. \nLooping with Conditions \nNow we can combine the if and for statements. We will loop over every item of the list, and print the item only if it ends with the letter l. We’ll pick another name for the variable to demonstrate that Python doesn’t try to make sense of variable names. \n>>> sent1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Call', 'me', 'Ishmael', '.']   \n>>> for xyzzy in sent1: if xyzzy.endswith('l'): print xyzzy   \nCall   \nIshmael   \n>>> \nYou will notice that if and for statements have a colon at the end of the line, before the indentation begins. In fact, all Python control structures end with a colon. The colon indicates that the current statement relates to the indented block that follows. \nWe can also specify an action to be taken if the condition of the if statement is not met. Here we see the elif (else if) statement, and the else statement. Notice that these also have colons before the indented code. \n>>> for token in sent1: if token.islower(): print token, 'is a lowercase word' elif token.istitle(): print token, 'is a titlecase word' else: print token, 'is punctuation'   \nCall is a titlecase word \nme is a lowercase word \nIshmael is a titlecase word   \n. is punctuation   \n>>> \nAs you can see, even with this small amount of Python knowledge, you can start to build multiline Python programs. It’s important to develop such programs in pieces, testing that each piece does what you expect before combining them into a program. This is why the Python interactive interpreter is so invaluable, and why you should get comfortable using it. \nFinally, let’s combine the idioms we’ve been exploring. First, we create a list of cie and cei words, then we loop over each item and print it. Notice the comma at the end of the print statement, which tells Python to produce its output on a single line. \n>>> tricky $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sorted([w for $w$ in set(text2) if 'cie' in w or 'cei' in w]) >>> for word in tricky:   \nprint word,   \nancient ceiling conceit conceited conceive conscience   \nconscientious conscientiously deceitful deceive ..   \n>>> \n1.5  Automatic Natural Language Understanding \nWe have been exploring language bottom-up, with the help of texts and the Python programming language. However, we’re also interested in exploiting our knowledge of language and computation by building useful language technologies. We’ll take the opportunity now to step back from the nitty-gritty of code in order to paint a bigger picture of natural language processing. \nAt a purely practical level, we all need help to navigate the universe of information locked up in text on the Web. Search engines have been crucial to the growth and popularity of the Web, but have some shortcomings. It takes skill, knowledge, and some luck, to extract answers to such questions as: What tourist sites can I visit between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on a limited budget? What do experts say about digital SLR cameras? What predictions about the steel market were made by credible commentators in the past week? Getting a computer to answer them automatically involves a range of language processing tasks, including information extraction, inference, and summarization, and would need to be carried out on a scale and with a level of robustness that is still beyond our current capabilities. \nOn a more philosophical level, a long-standing challenge within artificial intelligence has been to build intelligent machines, and a major part of intelligent behavior is understanding language. For many years this goal has been seen as too difficult. However, as NLP technologies become more mature, and robust methods for analyzing unrestricted text become more widespread, the prospect of natural language understanding has re-emerged as a plausible goal.",

The preposition before is initially translated into the corresponding German preposition vor, but later into the conjunction bevor (line 5). After line 5 the sentences become non-sensical (but notice the various phrasings indicated by the commas, and the change from jump to leap). The translation system did not recognize when a word was part of a proper name, and it misinterpreted the grammatical structure. The grammatical problems are more obvious in the following example. Did John find the pig, or did the pig find John? \n>>> babelize_shell()   \nBabel> The pig that John found looked happy   \nBabel> german   \nBabel> run   \n0> The pig that John found looked happy   \n1> Das Schwein, das John fand, schaute gl?cklich   \n2> The pig, which found John, looked happy \nMachine translation is difficult because a given word could have several possible translations (depending on its meaning), and because word order must be changed in keeping with the grammatical structure of the target language. Today these difficulties are being faced by collecting massive quantities of parallel texts from news and government websites that publish documents in two or more languages. Given a document in German and English, and possibly a bilingual dictionary, we can automatically pair up the sentences, a process called text alignment. Once we have a million or more sentence pairs, we can detect corresponding words and phrases, and build a model that can be used for translating new text. \nSpoken Dialogue Systems \nIn the history of artificial intelligence, the chief measure of intelligence has been a linguistic one, namely the Turing Test: can a dialogue system, responding to a user’s text input, perform so naturally that we cannot distinguish it from a human-generated response? In contrast, today’s commercial dialogue systems are very limited, but still perform useful functions in narrowly defined domains, as we see here: \nS: How may I help you?   \nU: When is Saving Private Ryan playing?   \nS: For what theater?   \nU: The Paramount theater.   \nS: Saving Private Ryan is not playing at the Paramount theater, but it’s playing at the Madison theater at 3:00, 5:30, 8:00, and 10:30. \nYou could not ask this system to provide driving instructions or details of nearby restaurants unless the required information had already been stored and suitable questionanswer pairs had been incorporated into the language processing system. \nObserve that this system seems to understand the user’s goals: the user asks when a movie is showing and the system correctly determines from this that the user wants to see the movie. This inference seems so obvious that you probably didn’t notice it was made, yet a natural language system needs to be endowed with this capability in order to interact naturally. Without it, when asked, Do you know when Saving Private Ryan is playing?, a system might unhelpfully respond with a cold Yes. However, the developers of commercial dialogue systems use contextual assumptions and business logic to ensure that the different ways in which a user might express requests or provide information are handled in a way that makes sense for the particular application. So, if you type When is ..., or I want to know when ..., or Can you tell me when ..., simple rules will always yield screening times. This is enough for the system to provide a useful service. \nDialogue systems give us an opportunity to mention the commonly assumed pipeline for NLP. Figure 1-5 shows the architecture of a simple dialogue system. Along the top of the diagram, moving from left to right, is a “pipeline” of some language understanding components. These map from speech input via syntactic parsing to some kind of meaning representation. Along the middle, moving from right to left, is the reverse pipeline of components for converting concepts to speech. These components make up the dynamic aspects of the system. At the bottom of the diagram are some representative bodies of static information: the repositories of language-related data that the processing components draw on to do their work. \nYour Turn: For an example of a primitive dialogue system, try having a conversation with an NLTK chatbot. To see the available chatbots, run nltk.chat.chatbots(). (Remember to import nltk first.)",

The basic scenario is simple. Suppose you want to find evidence to support the hypothesis: Sandra Goudie was defeated by Max Purnell, and that you have another short text that seems to be relevant, for example, Sandra Goudie was first elected to Parliament in the 2002 elections, narrowly winning the seat of Coromandel by defeating Labour candidate Max Purnell and pushing incumbent Green MP Jeanette Fitzsimons into third place. Does the text provide enough evidence for you to accept the hypothesis? In this particular case, the answer will be “No.” You can draw this conclusion easily, but it is very hard to come up with automated methods for making the right decision. The RTE Challenges provide data that allow competitors to develop their systems, but not enough data for “brute force” machine learning techniques (a topic we will cover in Chapter 6). Consequently, some linguistic analysis is crucial. In the previous example, it is important for the system to note that Sandra Goudie names the person being defeated in the hypothesis, not the person doing the defeating in the text. As another illustration of the difficulty of the task, consider the following text-hypothesis pair: \n(7) a. Text: David Golinkin is the editor or author of 18 books, and over 150 responsa, articles, sermons and books b. Hypothesis: Golinkin has written 18 books",

Hypothesis: Golinkin has written 18 books \nIn order to determine whether the hypothesis is supported by the text, the system needs the following background knowledge: (i) if someone is an author of a book, then he/ she has written that book; (ii) if someone is an editor of a book, then he/she has not written (all of) that book; (iii) if someone is editor or author of 18 books, then one cannot conclude that he/she is author of 18 books. \nLimitations of NLP \nDespite the research-led advances in tasks such as RTE, natural language systems that have been deployed for real-world applications still cannot perform common-sense reasoning or draw on world knowledge in a general and robust manner. We can wait for these difficult artificial intelligence problems to be solved, but in the meantime it is necessary to live with some severe limitations on the reasoning and knowledge capabilities of natural language systems. Accordingly, right from the beginning, an important goal of NLP research has been to make progress on the difficult task of building technologies that “understand language,” using superficial yet powerful techniques instead of unrestricted knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Indeed, this is one of the goals of this book, and we hope to equip you with the knowledge and skills to build useful NLP systems, and to contribute to the long-term aspiration of building intelligent machines. \n1.6  Summary \n• Texts are represented in Python using lists: ['Monty', 'Python']. We can use indexing, slicing, and the len() function on lists.   \n• A word “token” is a particular appearance of a given word in a text; a word “type” is the unique form of the word as a particular sequence of letters. We count word tokens using len(text) and word types using len(set(text)).   \n• We obtain the vocabulary of a text t using sorted(set(t)).   \n• We operate on each item of a text using $left[ mathsf { f } left( mathsf { x } right) right.$ for x in text].   \n• To derive the vocabulary, collapsing case distinctions and ignoring punctuation, we can write set([w.lower() for $w$ in text if w.isalpha()]).   \n• We process each word in a text using a for statement, such as for $boldsymbol { mathsf { w } }$ in t: or for word in text:. This must be followed by the colon character and an indented block of code, to be executed each time through the loop. We test a condition using an if statement: if $mathrm { l e n } ( mathsf { w o r d } )  <  5 colon$ This must be followed by the colon character and an indented block of code, to be executed only if the condition is true.   \n• A frequency distribution is a collection of items along with their frequency counts (e.g., the words of a text and their frequency of appearance).",

Try the following Python expression: set(sent3) < set(text1). Experiment with this using different arguments to set(). What does it do? Can you think of a practical application for this? \nAccessing Text Corpora and Lexical Resources \nPractical work in Natural Language Processing typically uses large bodies of linguistic data, or corpora. The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions: \n1. What are some useful text corpora and lexical resources, and how can we access them with Python?   \n2. Which Python constructs are most helpful for this work?   \n3. How do we avoid repeating ourselves when writing Python code? \nThis chapter continues to present programming concepts by example, in the context of a linguistic processing task. We will wait until later before exploring each Python construct systematically. Don’t worry if you see an example that contains something unfamiliar; simply try it out and see what it does, and—if you’re game—modify it by substituting some part of the code with a different text or word. This way you will associate a task with a programming idiom, and learn the hows and whys later. \n2.1  Accessing Text Corpora \nAs just mentioned, a text corpus is a large body of text. Many corpora are designed to contain a careful balance of material in one or more genres. We examined some small text collections in Chapter 1, such as the speeches known as the US Presidential Inaugural Addresses. This particular corpus actually contains dozens of individual texts— one per address—but for convenience we glued them end-to-end and treated them as a single text. Chapter 1 also used various predefined texts that we accessed by typing from book import *. However, since we want to be able to work with other texts, this section examines a variety of text corpora. We’ll see how to select individual texts, and how to work with them.",

        "content": "Gutenberg Corpus \nNLTK includes a small selection of texts from the Project Gutenberg electronic text archive, which contains some 25,000 free electronic books, hosted at http://www.gu tenberg.org/. We begin by getting the Python interpreter to load the NLTK package, then ask to see nltk.corpus.gutenberg.fileids(), the file identifiers in this corpus: \n>>> import nltk   \n>>> nltk.corpus.gutenberg.fileids()   \n['austen-emma.txt', 'austen-persuasion.txt', 'austen-sense.txt', 'bible-kjv.txt',   \n'blake-poems.txt', 'bryant-stories.txt', 'burgess-busterbrown.txt',   \n'carroll-alice.txt', 'chesterton-ball.txt', 'chesterton-brown.txt',   \n'chesterton-thursday.txt', 'edgeworth-parents.txt', 'melville-moby_dick.txt',   \n'milton-paradise.txt', 'shakespeare-caesar.txt', 'shakespeare-hamlet.txt',   \n'shakespeare-macbeth.txt', 'whitman-leaves.txt'] \nLet’s pick out the first of these texts—Emma by Jane Austen—and give it a short name, emma, then find out how many words it contains: \n>>> emma $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.gutenberg.words('austen-emma.txt')   \n>>> len(emma)   \n192427 \nIn Section 1.1, we showed how you could carry out concordancing of a text such as text1 with the command text1.concordance(). However, this assumes that you are using one of the nine texts obtained as a result of doing from nltk.book import *. Now that you have started examining data from nltk.corpus, as in the previous example, you have to employ the following pair of statements to perform concordancing and other tasks from Section 1.1: \n>>> emma $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Text(nltk.corpus.gutenberg.words('austen-emma.txt')) >>> emma.concordance(\"surprize\") \nWhen we defined emma, we invoked the words() function of the gutenberg object in NLTK’s corpus package. But since it is cumbersome to type such long names all the time, Python provides another version of the import statement, as follows: \n>>> from nltk.corpus import gutenberg   \n>>> gutenberg.fileids()   \n['austen-emma.txt', 'austen-persuasion.txt', 'austen-sense.txt', ...]   \n>>> emma $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ gutenberg.words('austen-emma.txt') \nLet’s write a short program to display other information about each text, by looping over all the values of fileid corresponding to the gutenberg file identifiers listed earlier and then computing statistics for each text. For a compact output display, we will make sure that the numbers are all integers, using int(). \n>>> for fileid in gutenberg.fileids(): num_chars $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(gutenberg.raw(fileid)) num_words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(gutenberg.words(fileid)) num_sents $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(gutenberg.sents(fileid)) \nnum_vocab $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(set([w.lower() for $w$ in gutenberg.words(fileid)]))   \nprint int(num_chars/num_words), int(num_words/num_sents), int(num_words/num_vocab),   \nfileid   \n4 21 26 austen-emma.txt   \n4 23 16 austen-persuasion.txt   \n4 24 22 austen-sense.txt   \n4 33 79 bible-kjv.txt   \n4 18 5 blake-poems.txt   \n4 17 14 bryant-stories.txt   \n4 17 12 burgess-busterbrown.txt   \n4 16 12 carroll-alice.txt   \n4 17 11 chesterton-ball.txt   \n4 19 11 chesterton-brown.txt   \n4 16 10 chesterton-thursday.txt   \n4 18 24 edgeworth-parents.txt   \n4 24 15 melville-moby_dick.txt   \n4 52 10 milton-paradise.txt   \n4 12 8 shakespeare-caesar.txt   \n4 13 7 shakespeare-hamlet.txt   \n4 13 6 shakespeare-macbeth.txt   \n4 35 12 whitman-leaves.txt \nThis program displays three statistics for each text: average word length, average sentence length, and the number of times each vocabulary item appears in the text on average (our lexical diversity score). Observe that average word length appears to be a general property of English, since it has a recurrent value of 4. (In fact, the average word length is really 3, not 4, since the num_chars variable counts space characters.) By contrast average sentence length and lexical diversity appear to be characteristics of particular authors. \nThe previous example also showed how we can access the “raw” text of the book $bullet$ , not split up into tokens. The raw() function gives us the contents of the file without any linguistic processing. So, for example, len(gutenberg.raw('blake-poems.txt') tells us how many letters occur in the text, including the spaces between words. The sents() function divides the text up into its sentences, where each sentence is a list of words: \n>>> macbeth_sentences $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ gutenberg.sents('shakespeare-macbeth.txt')   \n>>> macbeth_sentences   \n[['[', 'The', 'Tragedie', 'of', 'Macbeth', 'by', 'William', 'Shakespeare',   \n'1603', ']'], ['Actus', 'Primus', '.'], ...]   \n>>> macbeth_sentences[1037]   \n['Double', ,', 'double', 'toile', 'and', 'trouble', '   \n'Fire', 'burne', ', 1 'and', 'Cauldron', 'bubble']   \n>>> longest_len $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ max([len(s) for s in macbeth_sentences])   \n>>> [s for s in macbeth_sentences if len(s) $scriptstyle = =$ longest_len]   \n[['Doubtfull', 'it', 'stood', ,', 'As', 'two', 'spent', 'Swimmers 'that',   \n'doe', 'cling', 'together', 'And', 'choake', 'their', 'Art', 'The',   \n'mercilesse', 'Macdonwald', ...], ...] \nMost NLTK corpus readers include a variety of access methods apart from words(), raw(), and sents(). Richer linguistic content is available from some corpora, such as part-of-speech tags, dialogue tags, syntactic trees, and so forth; we will see these in later chapters. \nWeb and Chat Text \nAlthough Project Gutenberg contains thousands of books, it represents established literature. It is important to consider less formal language as well. NLTK’s small collection of web text includes content from a Firefox discussion forum, conversations overheard in New York, the movie script of Pirates of the Carribean, personal advertisements, and wine reviews: \n>>> from nltk.corpus import webtext   \n>>> for fileid in webtext.fileids():   \nprint fileid, webtext.raw(fileid)[:65], '   \nfirefox.txt Cookie Manager: \"Don't allow sites that set removed cookies to se.. grail.txt SCENE 1: [wind] [clop clop clop] KING ARTHUR: Whoa there!

Polished leather and strawb... \nThere is also a corpus of instant messaging chat sessions, originally collected by the Naval Postgraduate School for research on automatic detection of Internet predators.

This corpus contains text from 500 sources, and the sources have been categorized by genre, such as news, editorial, and so on. Table 2-1 gives an example of each genre (for a complete list, see http://icame.uib.no/brown/bcm-los.html). \nWe can access the corpus as a list of words or a list of sentences (where each sentence is itself just a list of words). We can optionally specify particular categories or files to read: \n>>> from nltk.corpus import brown   \n>>> brown.categories()   \n['adventure', 'belles_lettres', 'editorial', 'fiction', 'government', 'hobbies',   \n'humor', 'learned', 'lore', 'mystery', 'news', 'religion', 'reviews', 'romance',   \n'science_fiction']   \n>>> brown.words(categories $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'news')   \n['The', 'Fulton', 'County', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'said', ...]   \n>>> brown.words(fileids $ c =$ ['cg22'])   \n['Does', 'our', 'society', 'have', 'a', 'runaway', ',', ...]   \n>>> brown.sents(categories $ O =$ ['news', 'editorial', 'reviews'])   \n[['The', 'Fulton', 'County'...], ['The', 'jury', 'further'...], ...] \nThe Brown Corpus is a convenient resource for studying systematic differences between genres, a kind of linguistic inquiry known as stylistics. Let’s compare genres in their usage of modal verbs. The first step is to produce the counts for a particular genre. Remember to import nltk before doing the following: \n>>> from nltk.corpus import brown   \n>>> news_text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown.words(categories $ v { r } =  v { r }$ 'news')   \n>>> fdist $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FreqDist([w.lower() for w in news_text])   \n>>> modals $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['can', 'could', 'may', 'might', 'must', 'will']   \n$gg >$ for m in modals: print m + ':', fdist[m], \nYour Turn: Choose a different section of the Brown Corpus, and adapt the preceding example to count a selection of wh words, such as what, when, where, who and why. \nNext, we need to obtain counts for each genre of interest. We’ll use NLTK’s support for conditional frequency distributions. These are presented systematically in Section 2.2, where we also unpick the following code line by line. For the moment, you can ignore the details and just concentrate on the output. \n>>> cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist( (genre, word) for genre in brown.categories() for word in brown.words(categories $ v { r } =  v { r }$ genre))   \n>>> genres $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['news', 'religion', 'hobbies', 'science_fiction', 'romance', 'humor']   \n>>> modals $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['can', 'could', 'may', 'might', 'must', 'will']   \n>>> cfd.tabulate(conditions=genres, samples $ c =$ modals) can could may might must will news 93 86 66 38 50 389 religion 82 59 78 12 54 71 hobbies 268 58 131 22 83 264   \nscience_fiction 16 49 4 12 8 16 romance 74 193 11 51 45 43 humor 16 30 8 8 9 13 \nObserve that the most frequent modal in the news genre is will, while the most frequent modal in the romance genre is could. Would you have predicted this? The idea that word counts might distinguish genres will be taken up again in Chapter 6. \nReuters Corpus \nThe Reuters Corpus contains 10,788 news documents totaling 1.3 million words. The documents have been classified into 90 topics, and grouped into two sets, called “training” and “test”; thus, the text with fileid 'test/14826' is a document drawn from the test set. This split is for training and testing algorithms that automatically detect the topic of a document, as we will see in Chapter 6. \n>>> from nltk.corpus import reuters   \n>>> reuters.fileids()   \n['test/14826', 'test/14828', 'test/14829', 'test/14832', ...]   \n>>> reuters.categories()   \n['acq', 'alum', 'barley', 'bop', 'carcass', 'castor-oil', 'cocoa',   \n'coconut', 'coconut-oil', 'coffee', 'copper', 'copra-cake', 'corn',   \n'cotton', 'cotton-oil', 'cpi', 'cpu', 'crude', 'dfl', 'dlr', ...] \nUnlike the Brown Corpus, categories in the Reuters Corpus overlap with each other, simply because a news story often covers multiple topics. We can ask for the topics covered by one or more documents, or for the documents included in one or more categories. For convenience, the corpus methods accept a single fileid or a list of fileids.",

To get the year out of the filename, we extracted the first four characters, using fileid[:4]. \nLet’s look at how the words America and citizen are used over time. The following code converts the words in the Inaugural corpus to lowercase using w.lower() , then checks whether they start with either of the “targets” america or citizen using startswith() $bullet$ . Thus it will count words such as American’s and Citizens. We’ll learn about conditional frequency distributions in Section 2.2; for now, just consider the output, shown in Figure 2-1.",

Note that True and False are Python’s built-in Boolean values. \n>>> from nltk.corpus import udhr   \n>>> languages $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Chickasaw', 'English', 'German_Deutsch', 'Greenlandic_Inuktikut', 'Hungarian_Magyar', 'Ibibio_Efik']   \n>>> cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist( (lang, len(word)) for lang in languages for word in udhr.words(lang $^ +$ '-Latin1'))   \n>>> cfd.plot(cumulative=True) \nYour Turn: Pick a language of interest in udhr.fileids(), and define a variable raw_text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ udhr.raw(Language-Latin1). Now plot a frequency distribution of the letters of the text using \nnltk.FreqDist(raw_text).plot(). \nUnfortunately, for many languages, substantial corpora are not yet available. Often there is insufficient government or industrial support for developing language resources, and individual efforts are piecemeal and hard to discover or reuse. Some languages have no established writing system, or are endangered. (See Section 2.7 for suggestions on how to locate language resources.) \nText Corpus Structure \nWe have seen a variety of corpus structures so far; these are summarized in Figure 2-3. The simplest kind lacks any structure: it is just a collection of texts. Often, texts are grouped into categories that might correspond to genre, source, author, language, etc. Sometimes these categories overlap, notably in the case of topical categories, as a text can be relevant to more than one topic. Occasionally, text collections have temporal structure, news collections being the most common example. \nNLTK’s corpus readers support efficient access to a variety of corpora, and can be used to work with new corpora.

A conditional frequency distribution is a collection of frequency distributions, each one for a different “condition.” The condition will often be the category of the text.

The condition is either of the words america or citizen $pmb { theta }$ , and the counts being plotted are the number of times the word occurred in a particular speech. It exploits the fact that the filename for each speech—for example, 1865-Lincoln.txt—contains the year as the first four characters $bullet$ . This code generates the pair ('america', '1865') for every instance of a word whose lowercased form starts with america—such as Americans—in the file 1865-Lincoln.txt. \n>>> from nltk.corpus import inaugural   \n>>> cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist( (target, fileid[:4]) for fileid in inaugural.fileids() for w in inaugural.words(fileid) for target in ['america', 'citizen'] if w.lower().startswith(target)) \nThe plot in Figure 2-2 was also based on a conditional frequency distribution, reproduced in the following code. This time, the condition is the name of the language, and the counts being plotted are derived from word lengths . It exploits the fact that the filename for each language is the language name followed by '-Latin1' (the character encoding). \n>>> from nltk.corpus import udhr   \n$gg gg$ languages $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Chickasaw', 'English', 'German_Deutsch', 'Greenlandic_Inuktikut', 'Hungarian_Magyar', 'Ibibio_Efik']   \n>>> cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist( (lang, len(word)) for lang in languages for word in udhr.words(lang + '-Latin1')) \nIn the plot() and tabulate() methods, we can optionally specify which conditions to display with a conditions $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ parameter. When we omit it, we get all the conditions. Similarly, we can limit the samples to display with a samples $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ parameter. This makes it possible to load a large quantity of data into a conditional frequency distribution, and then to explore it by plotting or tabulating selected conditions and samples. It also gives us full control over the order of conditions and samples in any displays. For example, we can tabulate the cumulative frequency data just for two languages, and for words less than 10 characters long, as shown next. We interpret the last cell on the top row to mean that 1,638 words of the English text have nine or fewer letters. \n>>> cfd.tabulate(conditions $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['English', 'German_Deutsch'], samples $ c =$ range(10), cumulative=True) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 English 0 185 525 883 997 1166 1283 1440 1558 1638   \nGerman_Deutsch 0 171 263 614 717 894 1013 1110 1213 1275 \nYour Turn: Working with the news and romance genres from the Brown Corpus, find out which days of the week are most newsworthy, and which are most romantic. Define a variable called days containing a list of days of the week, i.e., ['Monday', ...]. Now tabulate the counts for these words using cfd.tabulate(samples $ L _ {  L } =$ days). Now try the same thing using plot in place of tabulate. You may control the output order of days with the help of an extra parameter: condi tions $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Monday', ...]. \nYou may have noticed that the multiline expressions we have been using with conditional frequency distributions look like list comprehensions, but without the brackets. In general, when we use a list comprehension as a parameter to a function, like set([w.lower for $w$ in t]), we are permitted to omit the square brackets and just write set(w.lower() for $w$ in t). (See the discussion of “generator expressions” in Section 4.2 for more about this.) \nGenerating Random Text with Bigrams \nWe can use a conditional frequency distribution to create a table of bigrams (word pairs, introduced in Section 1.3). The bigrams() function takes a list of words and builds a list of consecutive word pairs: \n>>> sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['In', 'the', 'beginning', 'God', 'created', 'the', 'heaven', 'and', 'the', 'earth', ']   \n>>> nltk.bigrams(sent)   \n[('In', 'the'), ('the', 'beginning'), ('beginning', 'God'), ('God', 'created'),   \n('created', 'the'), ('the', 'heaven'), ('heaven', 'and'), ('and', 'the'),   \n('the', 'earth'), ('earth', '.')] \nIn Example 2-1, we treat each word as a condition, and for each one we effectively create a frequency distribution over the following words. The function gener ate_model() contains a simple loop to generate text. When we call the function, we choose a word (such as 'living') as our initial context. Then, once inside the loop, we print the current value of the variable word, and reset word to be the most likely token in that context (using max()); next time through the loop, we use that word as our new context. As you can see by inspecting the output, this simple approach to text generation tends to get stuck in loops. Another method would be to randomly choose the next word from among the available words. \nExample 2-1. Generating random text: This program obtains all bigrams from the text of the book of Genesis, then constructs a conditional frequency distribution to record which words are most likely to follow a given word; e.g., after the word living, the most likely word is creature; the generate_model() function uses this data, and a seed word, to generate random text. \ndef generate_model(cfdist, word, num $scriptstyle 1 = 1 5$ ): for i in range(num): print word, word $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ cfdist[word].max()",

Generating random text: This program obtains all bigrams from the text of the book of Genesis, then constructs a conditional frequency distribution to record which words are most likely to follow a given word; e.g., after the word living, the most likely word is creature; the generate_model() function uses this data, and a seed word, to generate random text. \ndef generate_model(cfdist, word, num $scriptstyle 1 = 1 5$ ): for i in range(num): print word, word $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ cfdist[word].max() \ntext $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.genesis.words('english-kjv.txt') bigrams $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.bigrams(text) cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(bigrams) \n>>> print cfd['living']   \n<FreqDist: 'creature': 7, 'thing': 4, 'substance': 2, ',': 1, '.': 1, 'soul': 1>   \n>>> generate_model(cfd, 'living')   \nliving creature that he said , and the land of the land of the land Conditional frequency distributions are a useful data structure for many NLP tasks.   \nTheir commonly used methods are summarized in Table 2-4. \n\n2.3  More Python: Reusing Code \nBy this time you’ve probably typed and retyped a lot of code in the Python interactive interpreter. If you mess up when retyping a complex example, you have to enter it again. Using the arrow keys to access and modify previous commands is helpful but only goes so far. In this section, we see two important ways to reuse code: text editors and Python functions. \nCreating Programs with a Text Editor \nThe Python interactive interpreter performs your instructions as soon as you type them. Often, it is better to compose a multiline program using a text editor, then ask Python to run the whole program at once. Using IDLE, you can do this by going to the File menu and opening a new window. Try this now, and enter the following one-line program: \nprint 'Monty Python'",

Using IDLE, you can do this by going to the File menu and opening a new window. Try this now, and enter the following one-line program: \nprint 'Monty Python' \nSave this program in a file called monty.py, then go to the Run menu and select the command Run Module. (We’ll learn what modules are shortly.) The result in the main IDLE window should look like this: \n>>> == == RESTART ==   \n>>>   \nMonty Python   \n>>> \nYou can also type from monty import * and it will do the same thing. \nFrom now on, you have a choice of using the interactive interpreter or a text editor to create your programs. It is often convenient to test your ideas using the interpreter, revising a line of code until it does what you expect. Once you’re ready, you can paste the code (minus any $gg >$ or ... prompts) into the text editor, continue to expand it, and finally save the program in a file so that you don’t have to type it in again later. Give the file a short but descriptive name, using all lowercase letters and separating words with underscore, and using the .py filename extension, e.g., monty_python.py. \nImportant: Our inline code examples include the >>> and ... prompts as if we are interacting directly with the interpreter. As they get more complicated, you should instead type them into the editor, without the prompts, and run them from the editor as shown earlier. When we provide longer programs in this book, we will leave out the prompts to remind you to type them into a file rather than using the interpreter. You can see this already in Example 2-1. Note that the example still includes a couple of lines with the Python prompt; this is the interactive part of the task where you inspect some data and invoke a function. Remember that all code samples like Example 2-1 are downloadable from http://www.nltk.org/. \nFunctions \nSuppose that you work on analyzing text that involves different forms of the same word, and that part of your program needs to work out the plural form of a given singular noun. Suppose it needs to do this work in two places, once when it is processing some texts and again when it is processing user input. \nRather than repeating the same code several times over, it is more efficient and reliable to localize this work inside a function. A function is just a named block of code that performs some well-defined task, as we saw in Section 1.1. A function is usually defined to take some inputs, using special variables known as parameters, and it may produce a result, also known as a return value. We define a function using the keyword def followed by the function name and any input parameters, followed by the body of the function. Here’s the function we saw in Section 1.1 (including the import statement that makes division behave as expected):",

A function is just a named block of code that performs some well-defined task, as we saw in Section 1.1. A function is usually defined to take some inputs, using special variables known as parameters, and it may produce a result, also known as a return value. We define a function using the keyword def followed by the function name and any input parameters, followed by the body of the function. Here’s the function we saw in Section 1.1 (including the import statement that makes division behave as expected): \n>>> from _future__ import division >>> def lexical_diversity(text): return len(text) / len(set(text)) \nWe use the keyword return to indicate the value that is produced as output by the function. In this example, all the work of the function is done in the return statement. Here’s an equivalent definition that does the same work using multiple lines of code. We’ll change the parameter name from text to my_text_data to remind you that this is an arbitrary choice: \n>>> def lexical_diversity(my_text_data): word_count $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(my_text_data) vocab_size $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(set(my_text_data)) diversity_score $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ word_count / vocab_size return diversity_score \nNotice that we’ve created some new variables inside the body of the function. These are local variables and are not accessible outside the function. So now we have defined a function with the name lexical_diversity. But just defining it won’t produce any output! Functions do nothing until they are “called” (or “invoked”). \nLet’s return to our earlier scenario, and actually define a simple function to work out English plurals. The function plural() in Example 2-2 takes a singular noun and generates a plural form, though it is not always correct. (We’ll discuss functions at greater length in Section 4.4.) \nExample 2-2. A Python function: This function tries to work out the plural form of any English noun; the keyword def (define) is followed by the function name, then a parameter inside parentheses, and a colon; the body of the function is the indented block of code; it tries to recognize patterns within the word and process the word accordingly; e.g., if the word ends with y, delete the y and add ies. \ndef plural(word): if word.endswith('y'): return word[:-1] $^ +$ 'ies' elif word[-1] in 'sx' or word[-2:] in ['sh', 'ch']: return word $^ +$ 'es' elif word.endswith('an'): return word[:-2] $^ +$ 'en' else: return word $^ +$ 's'   \n>>> plural('fairy')   \n'fairies'   \n>>> plural('woman')   \n'women' \nThe endswith() function is always associated with a string object (e.g., word in Example 2-2). To call such functions, we give the name of the object, a period, and then the name of the function. These functions are usually known as methods. \nModules \nOver time you will find that you create a variety of useful little text-processing functions, and you end up copying them from old programs to new ones. Which file contains the latest version of the function you want to use? It makes life a lot easier if you can collect your work into a single place, and access previously defined functions without making copies. \nTo do this, save your function(s) in a file called (say) textproc.py. Now, you can access your work simply by importing it from the file: \n>>> from textproc import plural   \n>>> plural('wish')   \nwishes   \n>>> plural('fan')   \nfen \nOur plural function obviously has an error, since the plural of fan is fans. Instead of typing in a new version of the function, we can simply edit the existing one. Thus, at every stage, there is only one version of our plural function, and no confusion about which one is being used. \nA collection of variable and function definitions in a file is called a Python module. A collection of related modules is called a package. NLTK’s code for processing the Brown Corpus is an example of a module, and its collection of code for processing all the different corpora is an example of a package. NLTK itself is a set of packages, sometimes called a library. \nCaution! \nIf you are creating a file to contain some of your Python code, do not name your file nltk.py: it may get imported in place of the “real” NLTK package. When it imports modules, Python first looks in the current directory (folder). \n2.4  Lexical Resources \nA lexicon, or lexical resource, is a collection of words and/or phrases along with associated information, such as part-of-speech and sense definitions. Lexical resources are secondary to texts, and are usually created and enriched with the help of texts. For example, if we have defined a text my_text, then vocab $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sorted(set(my_text)) builds the vocabulary of my_text, whereas word_freq $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ FreqDist(my_text) counts the frequency of each word in the text. Both vocab and word_freq are simple lexical resources. Similarly, a concordance like the one we saw in Section 1.1 gives us information about word usage that might help in the preparation of a dictionary. Standard terminology for lexicons is illustrated in Figure 2-5. A lexical entry consists of a headword (also known as a lemma) along with additional information, such as the part-of-speech and the sense definition. Two distinct words having the same spelling are called homonyms.",

        "content": "The simplest kind of lexicon is nothing more than a sorted list of words. Sophisticated lexicons include complex structure within and across the individual entries. In this section, we’ll look at some lexical resources included with NLTK. \nWordlist Corpora \nNLTK includes some corpora that are nothing more than wordlists. The Words Corpus is the /usr/dict/words file from Unix, used by some spellcheckers. We can use it to find unusual or misspelled words in a text corpus, as shown in Example 2-3. \nExample 2-3. Filtering a text: This program computes the vocabulary of a text, then removes all items that occur in an existing wordlist, leaving just the uncommon or misspelled words. \ndef unusual_words(text): text_vocab $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ set(w.lower() for w in text if w.isalpha()) english_vocab $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ set(w.lower() for w in nltk.corpus.words.words()) unusual $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ text_vocab.difference(english_vocab) return sorted(unusual) \n>>> unusual_words(nltk.corpus.gutenberg.words('austen-sense.txt')) ['abbeyland', 'abhorrence', 'abominably', 'abridgement', 'accordant', 'accustomary', 'adieus', 'affability', 'affectedly', 'aggrandizement', 'alighted', 'allenham', 'amiably', 'annamaria', 'annuities', 'apologising', 'arbour', 'archness', ...] >>> unusual_words(nltk.corpus.nps_chat.words()) ['aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa', 'aaahhhh', 'abou', 'abourted', 'abs', 'ack', 'acros', 'actualy', 'adduser', 'addy', 'adoted', 'adreniline', 'ae', 'afe', 'affari', 'afk', 'agaibn', 'agurlwithbigguns', 'ahah', 'ahahah', 'ahahh', 'ahahha', 'ahem', 'ahh', ...] \nThere is also a corpus of stopwords, that is, high-frequency words such as the, to, and also that we sometimes want to filter out of a document before further processing. Stopwords usually have little lexical content, and their presence in a text fails to distinguish it from other texts. \n>>> from nltk.corpus import stopwords   \n>>> stopwords.words('english')   \n['a', \"a's\", 'able', 'about', 'above', 'according', 'accordingly', 'across', \n'actually', 'after', 'afterwards', 'again', 'against', \"ain't\", 'all', 'allow', 'allows', 'almost', 'alone', 'along', 'already', 'also', 'although', 'always', ...] \nLet’s define a function to compute what fraction of words in a text are not in the stopwords list: \n>>> def content_fraction(text): stopwords $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english') content $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [w for w in text if w.lower() not in stopwords] return len(content) / len(text)   \n>>> content_fraction(nltk.corpus.reuters.words())   \n0.65997695393285261 \nThus, with the help of stopwords, we filter out a third of the words of the text. Notice that we’ve combined two different kinds of corpus here, using a lexical resource to filter the content of a text corpus. \nE G I How many words of four letters or more can you make from those shown here?Eachlettermaybeusedonceperword.Eachword   \nV R V mustcontain the center letterand there mustbe at leastone nine-letter word.No pluralsending in \"s\";no foreign words; no proper names.   \n0 N L 21 words,good;32 words,very good; 42 words,excellent. \nA wordlist is useful for solving word puzzles, such as the one in Figure 2-6. Our program iterates through every word and, for each one, checks whether it meets the conditions. It is easy to check obligatory letter $bullet$ and length $bullet$ constraints (and we’ll only look for words with six or more letters here). It is trickier to check that candidate solutions only use combinations of the supplied letters, especially since some of the supplied letters appear twice (here, the letter $nu$ ). The FreqDist comparison method $bullet$ permits us to check that the frequency of each letter in the candidate word is less than or equal to the frequency of the corresponding letter in the puzzle. \n>>> puzzle_letters $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.FreqDist('egivrvonl')   \n$gg >$ obligatory $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'r'   \n>>> wordlist $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.words.words()   \n>>> [w for w in wordlist if $1 mathsf { e n } ( mathsf { w } )  mathsf { Omega } succ = mathsf { 6 }  pmb { cdot } mathsf { Omega }$ and obligatory in $w pmb Theta$ and nltk.FreqDist $mathrm { ( w ) } < =$ puzzle_letters]   \n['glover', 'gorlin', 'govern', 'grovel', 'ignore', 'involver', 'lienor',   \n'linger', 'longer', 'lovering', 'noiler', 'overling', 'region', 'renvoi',   \n'revolving', 'ringle', 'roving', 'violer', 'virole'] \nOne more wordlist corpus is the Names Corpus, containing 8,000 first names categorized by gender. The male and female names are stored in separate files. Let’s find names that appear in both files, i.e., names that are ambiguous for gender: \n>>> names $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.names   \n>>> names.fileids()   \n['female.txt', 'male.txt']   \n>>> male_names $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ names.words('male.txt')   \n>>> female_names $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ names.words('female.txt')   \n>>> [w for w in male_names if $w$ in female_names]   \n['Abbey', 'Abbie', 'Abby', 'Addie', 'Adrian', 'Adrien', 'Ajay', 'Alex', 'Alexis',   \n'Alfie', 'Ali', 'Alix', 'Allie', 'Allyn', 'Andie', 'Andrea', 'Andy', 'Angel',   \n'Angie', 'Ariel', 'Ashley', 'Aubrey', 'Augustine', 'Austin', 'Averil', ...] \nIt is well known that names ending in the letter a are almost always female. We can see this and some other patterns in the graph in Figure 2-7, produced by the following code. Remember that name[-1] is the last letter of name. \n>>> cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist( (fileid, name[-1]) for fileid in names.fileids() for name in names.words(fileid))   \n>>> cfd.plot() \nA Pronouncing Dictionary \nA slightly richer kind of lexical resource is a table (or spreadsheet), containing a word plus some properties in each row.

Observe that fire has two pronunciations (in U.S. English): the one-syllable F AY1 R, and the two-syllable F AY1 ER0. The symbols in the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary are from the Arpabet, described in more detail at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpabet. \nEach entry consists of two parts, and we can process these individually using a more complex version of the for statement. Instead of writing for entry in entries:, we replace entry with two variable names, word, pron .

Can you summarize the purpose of the following examples and explain how they work? \n>>> [w for w, pron in entries if pron[-1] $ =  ^ { prime } boldsymbol { M } ^ { prime }$ and $w [ - 1 ] = = mathbf { partial } ^ { prime } mathbf { n } ^ { prime } ]$ ['autumn', 'column', 'condemn', 'damn', 'goddamn', 'hymn', 'solemn'] >>> sorted(set(w[:2] for w, pron in entries if pron[0] $begin{array} { r } { mathbf { epsilon } = mathbf { epsilon } cdot mathbf { epsilon } mathbf { N } ^ { prime } } end{array}$ and $boldsymbol { mathsf { w } } [ 0 ] : = mathbf { mathsf { Omega } } ^ { prime } boldsymbol { mathsf { n } } ^ { prime } )$ ) ['gn', 'kn', 'mn', 'pn'] \nThe phones contain digits to represent primary stress (1), secondary stress (2), and no stress (0). As our final example, we define a function to extract the stress digits and then scan our lexicon to find words having a particular stress pattern. \n>>> def stress(pron): return [char for phone in pron for char in phone if char.isdigit()] >>> [w for w, pron in entries if stress(pron) $scriptstyle = =$ ['0', '1', '0', '2', '0']] ['abbreviated', 'abbreviating', 'accelerated', 'accelerating', 'accelerator', 'accentuated', 'accentuating', 'accommodated', 'accommodating', 'accommodative', 'accumulated', 'accumulating', 'accumulative', 'accumulator', 'accumulators', ..] >>> [w for w, pron in entries if stress(pron) $scriptstyle = =$ ['0', '2', '0', '1', '0']] ['abbreviation', 'abbreviations', 'abomination', 'abortifacient', 'abortifacients', 'academicians', 'accommodation', 'accommodations', 'accreditation', 'accreditations', 'accumulation', 'accumulations', 'acetylcholine', 'acetylcholine', 'adjudication', ...] \nA subtlety of this program is that our user-defined function stress() is invoked inside the condition of a list comprehension. There is also a doubly nested for loop. There’s a lot going on here, and you might want to return to this once you’ve had more experience using list comprehensions. \nWe can use a conditional frequency distribution to help us find minimally contrasting sets of words. Here we find all the $p$ words consisting of three sounds $pmb { theta }$ , and group them according to their first and last sounds $bullet$ . \nP-CH perch puche poche peach petsche poach pietsch putsch pautsch piche pet... \nP-K pik peek pic pique paque polk perc poke perk pac pock poch purk pak pa...   \nP-L pil poehl pille pehl pol pall pohl pahl paul perl pale paille perle po...   \nP-N paine payne pon pain pin pawn pinn pun pine paign pen pyne pane penn p...   \nP-P pap paap pipp paup pape pup pep poop pop pipe paape popp pip peep pope...   \nP-R paar poor par poore pear pare pour peer pore parr por pair porr pier...   \nP-S pearse piece posts pasts peace perce pos pers pace puss pesce pass pur...   \nP-T pot puett pit pete putt pat purt pet peart pott pett pait pert pote pa...   \nP-Z pays p.s pao's pais paws p.'s pas pez paz pei's pose poise peas paiz p... \nRather than iterating over the whole dictionary, we can also access it by looking up particular words. We will use Python’s dictionary data structure, which we will study systematically in Section 5.3. We look up a dictionary by specifying its name, followed by a key (such as the word 'fire') inside square brackets $bullet$ . \nIf we try to look up a non-existent key $pmb { theta }$ , we get a KeyError. This is similar to what happens when we index a list with an integer that is too large, producing an IndexEr ror. The word blog is missing from the pronouncing dictionary, so we tweak our version by assigning a value for this key $bullet$ (this has no effect on the NLTK corpus; next time we access it, blog will still be absent). \nWe can use any lexical resource to process a text, e.g., to filter out words having some lexical property (like nouns), or mapping every word of the text. For example, the following text-to-speech function looks up each word of the text in the pronunciation dictionary: \n>>> text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['natural', 'language', 'processing']   \n>>> [ph for $boldsymbol { mathsf { w } }$ in text for ph in prondict[w][0]]   \n['N', 'AE1', 'CH', 'ER0', 'AH0', 'L', 'L', 'AE1', 'NG', 'G', 'W', 'AH0', 'JH',   \n'P', 'R', 'AA1', 'S', 'EH0', 'S', 'IH0', 'NG'] \nComparative Wordlists \nAnother example of a tabular lexicon is the comparative wordlist. NLTK includes so-called Swadesh wordlists, lists of about 200 common words in several languages. The languages are identified using an ISO 639 two-letter code. \n>>> from nltk.corpus import swadesh   \n>>> swadesh.fileids()   \n['be', 'bg', 'bs', 'ca', 'cs', 'cu', 'de', 'en', 'es', 'fr', 'hr', 'it', 'la', 'mk',   \n'nl', 'pl', 'pt', 'ro', 'ru', 'sk', 'sl', 'sr', 'sw', 'uk']   \n>>> swadesh.words('en')   \n['I', 'you (singular), thou', 'he', 'we', 'you (plural)', 'they', 'this', 'that',",

We can explore these words with the help of WordNet: \n>>> from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn   \n>>> wn.synsets('motorcar')   \n[Synset('car.n.01')] \nThus, motorcar has just one possible meaning and it is identified as car.n.01, the first noun sense of car. The entity car.n.01 is called a synset, or “synonym set,” a collection of synonymous words (or “lemmas”): \n>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').lemma_names ['car', 'auto', 'automobile', 'machine', 'motorcar'] \nEach word of a synset can have several meanings, e.g., car can also signify a train carriage, a gondola, or an elevator car. However, we are only interested in the single meaning that is common to all words of this synset. Synsets also come with a prose definition and some example sentences: \n>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').definition   \n'a motor vehicle with four wheels; usually propelled by an internal combustion engine'   \n>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').examples   \n['he needs a car to get to work'] \nAlthough definitions help humans to understand the intended meaning of a synset, the words of the synset are often more useful for our programs. To eliminate ambiguity, we will identify these words as car.n.01.automobile, car.n.01.motorcar, and so on. This pairing of a synset with a word is called a lemma. We can get all the lemmas for a given synset , look up a particular lemma $pmb { theta }$ , get the synset corresponding to a lemma $bullet$ , and get the “name” of a lemma $bullet$ : \n>>> wn.synset('car.n.01').lemmas   \n[Lemma('car.n.01.car'), Lemma('car.n.01.auto'), Lemma('car.n.01.automobile'),   \nLemma('car.n.01.machine'), Lemma('car.n.01.motorcar')]   \n>>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile')   \nLemma('car.n.01.automobile')   \n>>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile').synset   \nSynset('car.n.01')   \n>>> wn.lemma('car.n.01.automobile').name 4   \n'automobile' \nUnlike the words automobile and motorcar, which are unambiguous and have one synset, the word car is ambiguous, having five synsets: \n>>> wn.synsets('car')   \n[Synset('car.n.01'), Synset('car.n.02'), Synset('car.n.03'), Synset('car.n.04'),   \nSynset('cable_car.n.01')]   \n>>> for synset in wn.synsets('car'): print synset.lemma_names   \n['car', 'auto', 'automobile', 'machine', 'motorcar']   \n['car', 'railcar', 'railway_car', 'railroad_car']   \n['car', 'gondola']   \n['car', 'elevator_car']   \n['cable_car', 'car'] \nFor convenience, we can access all the lemmas involving the word car as follows: \n>>> wn.lemmas('car') [Lemma('car.n.01.car'), Lemma('car.n.02.car'), Lemma('car.n.03.car'), Lemma('car.n.04.car'), Lemma('cable_car.n.01.car')] \nYour Turn: Write down all the senses of the word dish that you can think of. Now, explore this word with the help of WordNet, using the same operations shown earlier. \nThe WordNet Hierarchy \nWordNet synsets correspond to abstract concepts, and they don’t always have corresponding words in English. These concepts are linked together in a hierarchy. Some concepts are very general, such as Entity, State, Event; these are called unique beginners or root synsets. Others, such as gas guzzler and hatchback, are much more specific. A small portion of a concept hierarchy is illustrated in Figure 2-8. \nWordNet makes it easy to navigate between concepts. For example, given a concept like motorcar, we can look at the concepts that are more specific—the (immediate) hyponyms. \n>>> motorcar $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ wn.synset('car.n.01')   \n>>> types_of_motorcar $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ motorcar.hyponyms()   \n>>> types_of_motorcar[26]   \nSynset('ambulance.n.01')   \n>>> sorted([lemma.name for synset in types_of_motorcar for lemma in synset.lemmas])   \n['Model_T', 'S.U.V.', 'SUV', 'Stanley_Steamer', 'ambulance', 'beach_waggon',   \n'beach_wagon', 'bus', 'cab', 'compact', 'compact_car', 'convertible',   \n'coupe', 'cruiser', 'electric', 'electric_automobile', 'electric_car',   \n'estate_car', 'gas_guzzler', 'hack', 'hardtop', 'hatchback', 'heap',   \n'horseless_carriage', 'hot-rod', 'hot_rod', 'jalopy', 'jeep', 'landrover',   \n'limo', 'limousine', 'loaner', 'minicar', 'minivan', 'pace_car', 'patrol_car',",

Some words have multiple paths, because they can be classified in more than one way. There are two paths between car.n.01 and entity.n.01 because wheeled_vehicle.n.01 can be classified as both a vehicle and a container. \n>>> motorcar.hypernyms()   \n[Synset('motor_vehicle.n.01')]   \n>>> paths $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ motorcar.hypernym_paths()   \n>>> len(paths)   \n2   \n>>> [synset.name for synset in paths[0]]   \n['entity.n.01', 'physical_entity.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'whole.n.02', 'artifact.n.01',   \n'instrumentality.n.03', 'container.n.01', 'wheeled_vehicle.n.01',   \n'self-propelled_vehicle.n.01', 'motor_vehicle.n.01', 'car.n.01']   \n>>> [synset.name for synset in paths[1]]   \n['entity.n.01', 'physical_entity.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'whole.n.02', 'artifact.n.01',   \n'instrumentality.n.03', 'conveyance.n.03', 'vehicle.n.01', 'wheeled_vehicle.n.01',   \n'self-propelled_vehicle.n.01', 'motor_vehicle.n.01', 'car.n.01'] \nWe can get the most general hypernyms (or root hypernyms) of a synset as follows: \n>>> motorcar.root_hypernyms() [Synset('entity.n.01')] \nYour Turn: Try out NLTK’s convenient graphical WordNet browser: nltk.app.wordnet(). Explore the WordNet hierarchy by following the hypernym and hyponym links. \nMore Lexical Relations \nHypernyms and hyponyms are called lexical relations because they relate one synset to another. These two relations navigate up and down the “is-a” hierarchy. Another important way to navigate the WordNet network is from items to their components (meronyms) or to the things they are contained in (holonyms). For example, the parts of a tree are its trunk, crown, and so on; these are the part_meronyms(). The substance a tree is made of includes heartwood and sapwood, i.e., the substance_meronyms(). A collection of trees forms a forest, i.e., the member_holonyms(): \n>>> wn.synset('tree.n.01').part_meronyms()   \n[Synset('burl.n.02'), Synset('crown.n.07'), Synset('stump.n.01'),   \nSynset('trunk.n.01'), Synset('limb.n.02')]   \n>>> wn.synset('tree.n.01').substance_meronyms()   \n[Synset('heartwood.n.01'), Synset('sapwood.n.01')]",

Some words have multiple paths, because they can be classified in more than one way. There are two paths between car.n.01 and entity.n.01 because wheeled_vehicle.n.01 can be classified as both a vehicle and a container. \n>>> motorcar.hypernyms()   \n[Synset('motor_vehicle.n.01')]   \n>>> paths $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ motorcar.hypernym_paths()   \n>>> len(paths)   \n2   \n>>> [synset.name for synset in paths[0]]   \n['entity.n.01', 'physical_entity.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'whole.n.02', 'artifact.n.01',   \n'instrumentality.n.03', 'container.n.01', 'wheeled_vehicle.n.01',   \n'self-propelled_vehicle.n.01', 'motor_vehicle.n.01', 'car.n.01']   \n>>> [synset.name for synset in paths[1]]   \n['entity.n.01', 'physical_entity.n.01', 'object.n.01', 'whole.n.02', 'artifact.n.01',   \n'instrumentality.n.03', 'conveyance.n.03', 'vehicle.n.01', 'wheeled_vehicle.n.01',   \n'self-propelled_vehicle.n.01', 'motor_vehicle.n.01', 'car.n.01'] \nWe can get the most general hypernyms (or root hypernyms) of a synset as follows: \n>>> motorcar.root_hypernyms() [Synset('entity.n.01')] \nYour Turn: Try out NLTK’s convenient graphical WordNet browser: nltk.app.wordnet(). Explore the WordNet hierarchy by following the hypernym and hyponym links. \nMore Lexical Relations \nHypernyms and hyponyms are called lexical relations because they relate one synset to another. These two relations navigate up and down the “is-a” hierarchy. Another important way to navigate the WordNet network is from items to their components (meronyms) or to the things they are contained in (holonyms). For example, the parts of a tree are its trunk, crown, and so on; these are the part_meronyms(). The substance a tree is made of includes heartwood and sapwood, i.e., the substance_meronyms(). A collection of trees forms a forest, i.e., the member_holonyms(): \n>>> wn.synset('tree.n.01').part_meronyms()   \n[Synset('burl.n.02'), Synset('crown.n.07'), Synset('stump.n.01'),   \nSynset('trunk.n.01'), Synset('limb.n.02')]   \n>>> wn.synset('tree.n.01').substance_meronyms()   \n[Synset('heartwood.n.01'), Synset('sapwood.n.01')] \n>>> wn.synset('tree.n.01').member_holonyms() [Synset('forest.n.01')] \nTo see just how intricate things can get, consider the word mint, which has several closely related senses. We can see that mint.n.04 is part of mint.n.02 and the substance from which mint.n.05 is made. \n>>> for synset in wn.synsets('mint', wn.NOUN): print synset.name $^ +$ ':', synset.definition   \nbatch.n.02: (often followed by `of') a large number or amount or extent   \nmint.n.02: any north temperate plant of the genus Mentha with aromatic leaves and small mauve flowers   \nmint.n.03: any member of the mint family of plants   \nmint.n.04: the leaves of a mint plant used fresh or candied   \nmint.n.05: a candy that is flavored with a mint oil   \nmint.n.06: a plant where money is coined by authority of the government   \n>>> wn.synset('mint.n.04').part_holonyms()   \n[Synset('mint.n.02')]   \n>>> wn.synset('mint.n.04').substance_holonyms()   \n[Synset('mint.n.05')] \nThere are also relationships between verbs. For example, the act of walking involves the act of stepping, so walking entails stepping. Some verbs have multiple entailments: \n>>> wn.synset('walk.v.01').entailments() [Synset('step.v.01')] >>> wn.synset('eat.v.01').entailments() [Synset('swallow.v.01'), Synset('chew.v.01')] >>> wn.synset('tease.v.03').entailments() [Synset('arouse.v.07'), Synset('disappoint.v.01')] \nSome lexical relationships hold between lemmas, e.g., antonymy: \n>>> wn.lemma('supply.n.02.supply').antonyms()   \n[Lemma('demand.n.02.demand')]   \n>>> wn.lemma('rush.v.01.rush').antonyms()   \n[Lemma('linger.v.04.linger')]   \n>>> wn.lemma('horizontal.a.01.horizontal').antonyms()   \n[Lemma('vertical.a.01.vertical'), Lemma('inclined.a.02.inclined')]   \n>>> wn.lemma('staccato.r.01.staccato').antonyms()   \n[Lemma('legato.r.01.legato')] \nYou can see the lexical relations, and the other methods defined on a synset, using dir(). For example, try dir(wn.synset('harmony.n.02')). \nSemantic Similarity \nWe have seen that synsets are linked by a complex network of lexical relations. Given a particular synset, we can traverse the WordNet network to find synsets with related meanings. Knowing which words are semantically related is useful for indexing a collection of texts, so that a search for a general term such as vehicle will match documents containing specific terms such as limousine.",

Given a particular synset, we can traverse the WordNet network to find synsets with related meanings. Knowing which words are semantically related is useful for indexing a collection of texts, so that a search for a general term such as vehicle will match documents containing specific terms such as limousine. \nRecall that each synset has one or more hypernym paths that link it to a root hypernym such as entity.n.01. Two synsets linked to the same root may have several hypernyms in common (see Figure 2-8). If two synsets share a very specific hypernym—one that is low down in the hypernym hierarchy—they must be closely related. \n>>> right $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ wn.synset('right_whale.n.01')   \n>>> orca $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ wn.synset('orca.n.01')   \n>>> minke $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ wn.synset('minke_whale.n.01')   \n>>> tortoise $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ wn.synset('tortoise.n.01')   \n>>> novel $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ wn.synset('novel.n.01')   \n>>> right.lowest_common_hypernyms(minke)   \n[Synset('baleen_whale.n.01')]   \n>>> right.lowest_common_hypernyms(orca)   \n[Synset('whale.n.02')]   \n>>> right.lowest_common_hypernyms(tortoise)   \n[Synset('vertebrate.n.01')]   \n>>> right.lowest_common_hypernyms(novel)   \n[Synset('entity.n.01')] \nOf course we know that whale is very specific (and baleen whale even more so), whereas vertebrate is more general and entity is completely general. We can quantify this concept of generality by looking up the depth of each synset: \n>>> wn.synset('baleen_whale.n.01').min_depth()   \n14   \n>>> wn.synset('whale.n.02').min_depth()   \n13   \n>>> wn.synset('vertebrate.n.01').min_depth()   \n8   \n>>> wn.synset('entity.n.01').min_depth()   \n0 \nSimilarity measures have been defined over the collection of WordNet synsets that incorporate this insight. For example, path_similarity assigns a score in the range 0–1 based on the shortest path that connects the concepts in the hypernym hierarchy (-1 is returned in those cases where a path cannot be found). Comparing a synset with itself will return 1. Consider the following similarity scores, relating right whale to minke whale, orca, tortoise, and novel. Although the numbers won’t mean much, they decrease as we move away from the semantic space of sea creatures to inanimate objects. \n>>> right.path_similarity(minke)   \n0.25   \n>>> right.path_similarity(orca)   \n0.16666666666666666   \n>>> right.path_similarity(tortoise)   \n0.076923076923076927   \n>>> right.path_similarity(novel)   \n0.043478260869565216 \nSeveral other similarity measures are available; you can type help(wn) for more information.

The article gives the following statistic about teen language: “the top 20 words used, including yeah, no, but and like, account for around a third of all words.” How many word types account for a third of all word tokens, for a variety of text sources? What do you conclude about this statistic? Read more about this on LanguageLog, at http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/ languagelog/archives/003993.html.   \n11. ◑ Investigate the table of modal distributions and look for other patterns. Try to explain them in terms of your own impressionistic understanding of the different genres. Can you find other closed classes of words that exhibit significant differences across different genres?   \n12. ◑ The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary contains multiple pronunciations for certain words. How many distinct words does it contain? What fraction of words in this dictionary have more than one possible pronunciation?   \n13. ◑ What percentage of noun synsets have no hyponyms? You can get all noun synsets using wn.all_synsets $( ^ { prime } { mathsf { n } } ^ { prime } )$ .   \n14. ◑ Define a function supergloss(s) that takes a synset s as its argument and returns a string consisting of the concatenation of the definition of s, and the definitions of all the hypernyms and hyponyms of s.   \n15. ◑ Write a program to find all words that occur at least three times in the Brown Corpus.   \n16. ◑ Write a program to generate a table of lexical diversity scores (i.e., token/type ratios), as we saw in Table 1-1. Include the full set of Brown Corpus genres \n\n(nltk.corpus.brown.categories()). Which genre has the lowest diversity (greatest \nnumber of tokens per type)? Is this what you would have expected?   \n17. ◑ Write a function that finds the 50 most frequently occurring words of a text that are not stopwords.   \n18. ◑ Write a program to print the 50 most frequent bigrams (pairs of adjacent words) of a text, omitting bigrams that contain stopwords.   \n19. ◑ Write a program to create a table of word frequencies by genre, like the one given in Section 2.1 for modals. Choose your own words and try to find words whose presence (or absence) is typical of a genre. Discuss your findings.   \n20. ◑ Write a function word_freq() that takes a word and the name of a section of the Brown Corpus as arguments, and computes the frequency of the word in that section of the corpus.   \n21. $mathbf { 0 }$ Write a program to guess the number of syllables contained in a text, making use of the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary.   \n22. ◑ Define a function hedge(text) that processes a text and produces a new version with the word 'like' between every third word.   \n23. $bullet$ Zipf’s Law: Let $f ( boldsymbol { w } )$ be the frequency of a word $boldsymbol { w }$ in free text. Suppose that all the words of a text are ranked according to their frequency, with the most frequent word first. Zipf’s Law states that the frequency of a word type is inversely proportional to its rank (i.e., $f times r = k$ , for some constant $k$ ). For example, the 50th most common word type should occur three times as frequently as the 150th most common word type. a. Write a function to process a large text and plot word frequency against word rank using pylab.plot. Do you confirm Zipf’s law? (Hint: it helps to use a logarithmic scale.) What is going on at the extreme ends of the plotted line? b. Generate random text, e.g., using random.choice(\"abcdefg \"), taking care to include the space character. You will need to import random first. Use the string concatenation operator to accumulate characters into a (very) long string. Then tokenize this string, generate the Zipf plot as before, and compare the two plots. What do you make of Zipf’s Law in the light of this? \n24. $bullet$ Modify the text generation program in Example 2-1 further, to do the following tasks: \na. Store the $n$ most likely words in a list words, then randomly choose a word from the list using random.choice(). (You will need to import random first.)   \nb. Select a particular genre, such as a section of the Brown Corpus or a Genesis translation, one of the Gutenberg texts, or one of the Web texts. Train the model on this corpus and get it to generate random text. You may have to experiment with different start words. How intelligible is the text? Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this method of generating random text.   \nc. Now train your system using two distinct genres and experiment with generating text in the hybrid genre. Discuss your observations.   \n25. $bullet$ Define a function find_language() that takes a string as its argument and returns a list of languages that have that string as a word. Use the udhr corpus and limit your searches to files in the Latin-1 encoding.   \n26. $bullet$ What is the branching factor of the noun hypernym hierarchy? I.e., for every noun synset that has hyponyms—or children in the hypernym hierarchy—how many do they have on average? You can get all noun synsets using wn.all_syn sets $( ^ { prime } { mathsf { n } } ^ { prime } )$ .   \n27. $bullet$ The polysemy of a word is the number of senses it has. Using WordNet, we can determine that the noun dog has seven senses with len(wn.synsets $( ^ { prime } deg ^ { prime } , ^ { prime } sqcap ^ { prime } )$ ). Compute the average polysemy of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs according to WordNet.   \n28. $bullet$ Use one of the predefined similarity measures to score the similarity of each of the following pairs of words. Rank the pairs in order of decreasing similarity. How close is your ranking to the order given here, an order that was established experimentally by (Miller & Charles, 1998): car-automobile, gem-jewel, journey-voyage, boy-lad, coast-shore, asylum-madhouse, magician-wizard, midday-noon, furnacestove, food-fruit, bird-cock, bird-crane, tool-implement, brother-monk, ladbrother, crane-implement, journey-car, monk-oracle, cemetery-woodland, foodrooster, coast-hill, forest-graveyard, shore-woodland, monk-slave, coast-forest, lad-wizard, chord-smile, glass-magician, rooster-voyage, noon-string. \n\nProcessing Raw Text \nThe most important source of texts is undoubtedly the Web. It’s convenient to have existing text collections to explore, such as the corpora we saw in the previous chapters. However, you probably have your own text sources in mind, and need to learn how to access them. \nThe goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions: \n1. How can we write programs to access text from local files and from the Web, in order to get hold of an unlimited range of language material? 2. How can we split documents up into individual words and punctuation symbols, so we can carry out the same kinds of analysis we did with text corpora in earlier chapters? 3. How can we write programs to produce formatted output and save it in a file? \nIn order to address these questions, we will be covering key concepts in NLP, including tokenization and stemming. Along the way you will consolidate your Python knowledge and learn about strings, files, and regular expressions. Since so much text on the Web is in HTML format, we will also see how to dispense with markup. \nImportant: From this chapter onwards, our program samples will assume you begin your interactive session or your program with the following import statements: \n>>> from __future__ import division >>> import nltk, re, pprint",

        "content": "3.1  Accessing Text from the Web and from Disk \nElectronic Books \nA small sample of texts from Project Gutenberg appears in the NLTK corpus collection. However, you may be interested in analyzing other texts from Project Gutenberg. You can browse the catalog of 25,000 free online books at http://www.gutenberg.org/cata log/, and obtain a URL to an ASCII text file. Although $9 0 %$ of the texts in Project Gutenberg are in English, it includes material in over 50 other languages, including Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish (with more than 100 texts each). \nText number 2554 is an English translation of Crime and Punishment, and we can access it as follows. \n>>> from urllib import urlopen   \n>>> url $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2554/2554.txt\"   \n>>> raw $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ urlopen(url).read()   \n>>> type(raw)   \n<type 'str'>   \n>>> len(raw)   \n1176831   \n>>> raw[:75]   \n'The Project Gutenberg EBook of Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevskyrn' \nThe read() process will take a few seconds as it downloads this large book. If you’re using an Internet proxy that is not correctly detected by Python, you may need to specify the proxy manually as follows: \n>>> proxies $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ {'http': 'http://www.someproxy.com:3128'} >>> raw $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ urlopen(url, proxies=proxies).read() \nThe variable raw contains a string with 1,176,831 characters. (We can see that it is a string, using type(raw).) This is the raw content of the book, including many details we are not interested in, such as whitespace, line breaks, and blank lines. Notice the r and n in the opening line of the file, which is how Python displays the special carriage return and line-feed characters (the file must have been created on a Windows machine). For our language processing, we want to break up the string into words and punctuation, as we saw in Chapter 1. This step is called tokenization, and it produces our familiar structure, a list of words and punctuation. \n>>> tokens $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.word_tokenize(raw)   \n>>> type(tokens)   \n<type 'list'>   \n>>> len(tokens)   \n255809   \n>>> tokens[:10]   \n['The', 'Project', 'Gutenberg', 'EBook', 'of', 'Crime', 'and', 'Punishment', ',', 'by'] \nNotice that NLTK was needed for tokenization, but not for any of the earlier tasks of opening a URL and reading it into a string. If we now take the further step of creating an NLTK text from this list, we can carry out all of the other linguistic processing we saw in Chapter 1, along with the regular list operations, such as slicing: \n>>> text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Text(tokens)   \n>>> type(text)   \n<type 'nltk.text.Text'>   \n>>> text[1020:1060]   \n['CHAPTER', 'I', 'On', 'an', 'exceptionally', 'hot', 'evening', 'early', 'in', 'July', 'a', 'young', 'man', 'came' out' 'of', 'the', 'garret', 'in',   \n'which', 'he', 'lodged', 'in', ' 'Place', 'and', 'walked', 'slowly', , 'as', 'though', 'in', 'hesitation', 'towards', 'K', '.', 'bridge', .'] >>> text.collocations()   \nKaterina Ivanovna; Pulcheria Alexandrovna; Avdotya Romanovna; Pyotr   \nPetrovitch; Project Gutenberg; Marfa Petrovna; Rodion Romanovitch;   \nSofya Semyonovna; Nikodim Fomitch; did not; Hay Market; Andrey   \nSemyonovitch; old woman; Literary Archive; Dmitri Prokofitch; great   \ndeal; United States; Praskovya Pavlovna; Porfiry Petrovitch; ear rings \nNotice that Project Gutenberg appears as a collocation. This is because each text downloaded from Project Gutenberg contains a header with the name of the text, the author, the names of people who scanned and corrected the text, a license, and so on. Sometimes this information appears in a footer at the end of the file. We cannot reliably detect where the content begins and ends, and so have to resort to manual inspection of the file, to discover unique strings that mark the beginning and the end, before trimming raw to be just the content and nothing else: \n>>> raw.find(\"PART I\")   \n5303   \n>>> raw.rfind(\"End of Project Gutenberg's Crime\")   \n1157681   \n>>> raw $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ raw[5303:1157681]   \n>>> raw.find(\"PART I\")   \n0 \nThe find() and rfind() (“reverse find”) methods help us get the right index values to use for slicing the string $bullet$ . We overwrite raw with this slice, so now it begins with “PART ${ mathrm { I } } ^ { mathfrak { P } }$ and goes up to (but not including) the phrase that marks the end of the content. \nThis was our first brush with the reality of the Web: texts found on the Web may contain unwanted material, and there may not be an automatic way to remove it. But with a small amount of extra work we can extract the material we need. \nDealing with HTML \nMuch of the text on the Web is in the form of HTML documents. You can use a web browser to save a page as text to a local file, then access this as described in the later section on files. However, if you’re going to do this often, it’s easiest to get Python to do the work directly. The first step is the same as before, using urlopen. For fun we’ll pick a BBC News story called “Blondes to die out in 200 years,” an urban legend passed along by the BBC as established scientific fact:",

See Table 3-1 for an example. \nUnfortunately, search engines have some significant shortcomings. First, the allowable range of search patterns is severely restricted. Unlike local corpora, where you write programs to search for arbitrarily complex patterns, search engines generally only allow you to search for individual words or strings of words, sometimes with wildcards. Second, search engines give inconsistent results, and can give widely different figures when used at different times or in different geographical regions.

With some further work, we can write programs to create a small corpus of blog posts, and use this as the basis for our NLP work. \nReading Local Files \nIn order to read a local file, we need to use Python’s built-in open() function, followed by the read() method. Supposing you have a file document.txt, you can load its contents like this: \nYour Turn: Create a file called document.txt using a text editor, and type in a few lines of text, and save it as plain text. If you are using IDLE, select the New Window command in the File menu, typing the required text into this window, and then saving the file as document.txt inside the directory that IDLE offers in the pop-up dialogue box. Next, in the Python interpreter, open the file using $textsf { f } =$ open('document.txt'), then inspect its contents using print f.read(). \nVarious things might have gone wrong when you tried this. If the interpreter couldn’t find your file, you would have seen an error like this: \n>>> f = open('document.txt')   \nTraceback (most recent call last):   \nFile \"<pyshell#7>\", line 1, in -toplevel  \n$textsf { f } =$ open('document.txt')   \nIOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'document.txt' \nTo check that the file that you are trying to open is really in the right directory, use IDLE’s Open command in the File menu; this will display a list of all the files in the directory where IDLE is running. An alternative is to examine the current directory from within Python: \n>>> import os >>> os.listdir('.') \nAnother possible problem you might have encountered when accessing a text file is the newline conventions, which are different for different operating systems. The built-in open() function has a second parameter for controlling how the file is opened: open('do cument.txt', 'rU'). 'r' means to open the file for reading (the default), and 'U' stands for “Universal”, which lets us ignore the different conventions used for marking newlines. \nAssuming that you can open the file, there are several methods for reading it. The read() method creates a string with the contents of the entire file:",

With some further work, we can write programs to create a small corpus of blog posts, and use this as the basis for our NLP work. \nReading Local Files \nIn order to read a local file, we need to use Python’s built-in open() function, followed by the read() method. Supposing you have a file document.txt, you can load its contents like this: \nYour Turn: Create a file called document.txt using a text editor, and type in a few lines of text, and save it as plain text. If you are using IDLE, select the New Window command in the File menu, typing the required text into this window, and then saving the file as document.txt inside the directory that IDLE offers in the pop-up dialogue box. Next, in the Python interpreter, open the file using $textsf { f } =$ open('document.txt'), then inspect its contents using print f.read(). \nVarious things might have gone wrong when you tried this. If the interpreter couldn’t find your file, you would have seen an error like this: \n>>> f = open('document.txt')   \nTraceback (most recent call last):   \nFile \"<pyshell#7>\", line 1, in -toplevel  \n$textsf { f } =$ open('document.txt')   \nIOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'document.txt' \nTo check that the file that you are trying to open is really in the right directory, use IDLE’s Open command in the File menu; this will display a list of all the files in the directory where IDLE is running. An alternative is to examine the current directory from within Python: \n>>> import os >>> os.listdir('.') \nAnother possible problem you might have encountered when accessing a text file is the newline conventions, which are different for different operating systems. The built-in open() function has a second parameter for controlling how the file is opened: open('do cument.txt', 'rU'). 'r' means to open the file for reading (the default), and 'U' stands for “Universal”, which lets us ignore the different conventions used for marking newlines. \nAssuming that you can open the file, there are several methods for reading it. The read() method creates a string with the contents of the entire file: \n>>> f.read() 'Time flies like an arrow.nFruit flies like a banana.n' \nRecall that the 'n' characters are newlines; this is equivalent to pressing Enter on a keyboard and starting a new line. \nWe can also read a file one line at a time using a for loop: \n>>> f = open('document.txt', 'rU') >>> for line in f: print line.strip() Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana. \nHere we use the strip() method to remove the newline character at the end of the input line. \nNLTK’s corpus files can also be accessed using these methods. We simply have to use nltk.data.find() to get the filename for any corpus item. Then we can open and read it in the way we just demonstrated: \n>>> path $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.data.find('corpora/gutenberg/melville-moby_dick.txt') >>> raw $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ open(path, 'rU').read() \nExtracting Text from PDF, MSWord, and Other Binary Formats \nASCII text and HTML text are human-readable formats. Text often comes in binary formats—such as PDF and MSWord—that can only be opened using specialized software. Third-party libraries such as pypdf and pywin32 provide access to these formats. Extracting text from multicolumn documents is particularly challenging. For one-off conversion of a few documents, it is simpler to open the document with a suitable application, then save it as text to your local drive, and access it as described below. If the document is already on the Web, you can enter its URL in Google’s search box. The search result often includes a link to an HTML version of the document, which you can save as text. \nCapturing User Input \nSometimes we want to capture the text that a user inputs when she is interacting with our program. To prompt the user to type a line of input, call the Python function raw_input(). After saving the input to a variable, we can manipulate it just as we have done for other strings. \n>>> s $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ raw_input(\"Enter some text: \")   \nEnter some text: On an exceptionally hot evening early in July >>> print \"You typed\", len(nltk.word_tokenize(s)), \"words.\" You typed 8 words.",

If a string contains a single quote, we must backslash-escape the quote $bullet$ so Python knows a literal quote character is intended, or else put the string in double quotes .

Python provides us with various ways of entering them. In the next example, a sequence of two strings is joined into a single string. We need to use backslash $bullet$ or parentheses $pmb { theta }$ so that the interpreter knows that the statement is not complete after the first line. \n>>> couplet $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day?\" \"Thou are more lovely and more temperate:\"   \n$gg >$ print couplet   \nShall I compare thee to a Summer's day?Thou are more lovely and more temperate:   \n>>> couplet $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ (\"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\" \"And Summer's lease hath all too short a date:\")   \n>>> print couplet   \nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,And Summer's lease hath all too short a d \nUnfortunately these methods do not give us a newline between the two lines of the sonnet. Instead, we can use a triple-quoted string as follows: \n>>> couplet $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"\"\"Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day?   \n... Thou are more lovely and more temperate:\"\"\"   \n>>> print couplet   \nShall I compare thee to a Summer's day?   \nThou are more lovely and more temperate:   \n>>> couplet $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ '''Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,   \n... And Summer's lease hath all too short a date:''   \n>>> print couplet   \nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,   \nAnd Summer's lease hath all too short a date: \nNow that we can define strings, we can try some simple operations on them. First let’s look at the $^ +$ operation, known as concatenation . It produces a new string that is a copy of the two original strings pasted together end-to-end. Notice that concatenation doesn’t do anything clever like insert a space between the words. We can even multiply strings : \n>>> 'very' + 'very' $^ +$ 'very'   \n'veryveryvery'   \n>>> 'very' * 3   \n'veryveryvery' \nYour Turn: Try running the following code, then try to use your understanding of the string $^ +$ and $*$ operations to figure out how it works. Be careful to distinguish between the string ' ', which is a single whitespace character, and '', which is the empty string. \n${ bf gamma > > ~ a ~ = ~ [ 1 , ~ 2 , ~ 3 , ~ 4 , ~ 5 , ~ 6 , ~ 7 , ~ 6 , ~ 5 , ~ 4 , ~ 3 , ~ 2 , ~ 1 ] }$   \n$* > >  b = [ \" mathrm { ~ bf ~ \" ~ } * _ { 2 } * ( 7 mathrm { ~ bf ~ - ~ i ~ } ) + \" mathrm { v e r y ~ \" ~ } * _ { mathrm { ~ i ~ } } mathrm { f o r }$ i in a]   \n>>> for line in b: print b \nWe’ve seen that the addition and multiplication operations apply to strings, not just numbers. However, note that we cannot use subtraction or division with strings: \n>>> 'very' - 'y'   \nTraceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>   \nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'   \n>>> 'very' / 2   \nTraceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>   \nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int' \nThese error messages are another example of Python telling us that we have got our data types in a muddle. In the first case, we are told that the operation of subtraction (i.e., -) cannot apply to objects of type str (strings), while in the second, we are told that division cannot take str and int as its two operands. \nPrinting Strings \nSo far, when we have wanted to look at the contents of a variable or see the result of a calculation, we have just typed the variable name into the interpreter. We can also see the contents of a variable using the print statement: \n>>> print monty Monty Python \nNotice that there are no quotation marks this time. When we inspect a variable by typing its name in the interpreter, the interpreter prints the Python representation of its value. Since it’s a string, the result is quoted. However, when we tell the interpreter to print the contents of the variable, we don’t see quotation characters, since there are none inside the string. \nThe print statement allows us to display more than one item on a line in various ways, as shown here: \n>>> grail $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Holy Grail' >>> print monty $^ +$ grail Monty PythonHoly Grail >>> print monty, grail Monty Python Holy Grail >>> print monty, \"and the\", grail Monty Python and the Holy Grail \nAccessing Individual Characters \nAs we saw in Section 1.2 for lists, strings are indexed, starting from zero. When we index a string, we get one of its characters (or letters). A single character is nothing special—it’s just a string of length 1. \n>>> monty[0] 'M'   \n>>> monty[3] 't'   \n>>> monty[5] 1",

IndexError: string index out of range \nAgain as with lists, we can use negative indexes for strings, where $^ { - 1 }$ is the index of the last character . Positive and negative indexes give us two ways to refer to any position in a string. In this case, when the string had a length of 12, indexes 5 and -7 both refer to the same character (a space). (Notice that 5 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(monty) - 7.) \n>>> monty[-1] 1   \n'n'   \n>>> monty[5]   \n>>> monty[-7]   \n1 \nWe can write for loops to iterate over the characters in strings.

We can easily access substrings using the same slice notation we used for lists (see Figure 3-2).

For example, the following code accesses the substring starting at index 6, up to (but not including) index 10: \n>>> monty[6:10] 'Pyth' \nHere we see the characters are 'P', 'y', 't', and 'h', which correspond to monty[6] ... monty[9] but not monty[10]. This is because a slice starts at the first index but finishes one before the end index. \nWe can also slice with negative indexes—the same basic rule of starting from the start index and stopping one before the end index applies; here we stop before the space character. \n>>> monty[-12:-7] 'Monty' \nAs with list slices, if we omit the first value, the substring begins at the start of the string. If we omit the second value, the substring continues to the end of the string: \n>>> monty[:5] 'Monty'   \n>>> monty[6:] 'Python' \nWe test if a string contains a particular substring using the in operator, as follows: \n>>> phrase $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'And now for something completely different'   \n>>> if 'thing' in phrase: print 'found \"thing\"   \nfound \"thing\" \nWe can also find the position of a substring within a string, using find(): >>> monty.find('Python') 6 \nYour Turn: Make up a sentence and assign it to a variable, e.g., sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'my sentence... '. Now write slice expressions to pull out individual words. (This is obviously not a convenient way to process the words of a text!) \nMore Operations on Strings \nPython has comprehensive support for processing strings.

If we use a for loop to process the elements of this string, all we can pick out are the individual characters—we don’t get to choose the granularity. By contrast, the elements of a list can be as big or small as we like: for example, they could be paragraphs, sentences, phrases, words, characters. So lists have the advantage that we can be flexible about the elements they contain, and correspondingly flexible about any downstream processing. Consequently, one of the first things we are likely to do in a piece of NLP code is tokenize a string into a list of strings (Section 3.7). Conversely, when we want to write our results to a file, or to a terminal, we will usually format them as a string (Section 3.9). \nLists and strings do not have exactly the same functionality. Lists have the added power that you can change their elements: \n>>> beatles[0] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"John Lennon\"   \n>>> del beatles[-1]   \n>>> beatles   \n['John Lennon', 'Paul', 'George'] \nOn the other hand, if we try to do that with a string—changing the 0th character in query to 'F'—we get: \n>>> query[0] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'F'   \nTraceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in ?   \nTypeError: object does not support item assignment \nThis is because strings are immutable: you can’t change a string once you have created it. However, lists are mutable, and their contents can be modified at any time. As a result, lists support operations that modify the original value rather than producing a new value. \nYour Turn: Consolidate your knowledge of strings by trying some of the exercises on strings at the end of this chapter. \n3.3  Text Processing with Unicode \nOur programs will often need to deal with different languages, and different character sets. The concept of “plain text” is a fiction. If you live in the English-speaking world you probably use ASCII, possibly without realizing it. If you live in Europe you might use one of the extended Latin character sets, containing such characters as $^ { mathfrak { a } } mathfrak { o } ^ { mathfrak { n } }$ for Danish and Norwegian, $^ { mathfrak { s } } tilde { mathfrak { O } } ^ { mathfrak { n } }$ for Hungarian, “ñ” for Spanish and Breton, and $ \" tilde { mathsf { n } }  \" $ for Czech and Slovak. In this section, we will give an overview of how to use Unicode for processing texts that use non-ASCII character sets.",

        "content": "What Is Unicode? \nUnicode supports over a million characters. Each character is assigned a number, called a code point. In Python, code points are written in the form uXXXX, where XXXX is the number in four-digit hexadecimal form. \nWithin a program, we can manipulate Unicode strings just like normal strings. However, when Unicode characters are stored in files or displayed on a terminal, they must be encoded as a stream of bytes. Some encodings (such as ASCII and Latin-2) use a single byte per code point, so they can support only a small subset of Unicode, enough for a single language. Other encodings (such as UTF-8) use multiple bytes and can represent the full range of Unicode characters. \nText in files will be in a particular encoding, so we need some mechanism for translating it into Unicode—translation into Unicode is called decoding. Conversely, to write out Unicode to a file or a terminal, we first need to translate it into a suitable encoding— this translation out of Unicode is called encoding, and is illustrated in Figure 3-3. \nFrom a Unicode perspective, characters are abstract entities that can be realized as one or more glyphs. Only glyphs can appear on a screen or be printed on paper. A font is a mapping from characters to glyphs. \nExtracting Encoded Text from Files \nLet’s assume that we have a small text file, and that we know how it is encoded. For example, polish-lat2.txt, as the name suggests, is a snippet of Polish text (from the Polish Wikipedia; see http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioteka_Pruska). This file is encoded as Latin-2, also known as ISO-8859-2. The function nltk.data.find() locates the file for us.",

For example, polish-lat2.txt, as the name suggests, is a snippet of Polish text (from the Polish Wikipedia; see http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioteka_Pruska). This file is encoded as Latin-2, also known as ISO-8859-2. The function nltk.data.find() locates the file for us. \nThe Python codecs module provides functions to read encoded data into Unicode strings, and to write out Unicode strings in encoded form. The codecs.open() function takes an encoding parameter to specify the encoding of the file being read or written. So let’s import the codecs module, and call it with the encoding 'latin2' to open our Polish file as Unicode: \n>>> import codecs $> > > textsf { f } =$ codecs.open(path, encoding ${ bf Phi } = { bf Phi }$ latin2') \nFor a list of encoding parameters allowed by codecs, see http://docs.python.org/lib/ standard-encodings.html. Note that we can write Unicode-encoded data to a file using $textsf { f } =$ codecs.open(path, 'w', encoding $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ 'utf-8'). \nText read from the file object f will be returned in Unicode. As we pointed out earlier, in order to view this text on a terminal, we need to encode it, using a suitable encoding. The Python-specific encoding unicode_escape is a dummy encoding that converts all non-ASCII characters into their uXXXX representations. Code points above the ASCII 0–127 range but below 256 are represented in the two-digit form $backslash times X X$ . \n>>> for line in f: line $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ line.strip() print line.encode('unicode_escape')   \nPruska Biblioteka Pau0144stwowa.

Trafiu0142y do Biblioteki   \nJagiellou0144skiej w Krakowie, obejmuju0105 ponad 500 tys. zabytkowych   \narchiwalixf3w, m.in. manuskrypty Goethego, Mozarta, Beethovena, Bacha. \nThe first line in this output illustrates a Unicode escape string preceded by the u escape string, namely u0144. The relevant Unicode character will be displayed on the screen as the glyph ń. In the third line of the preceding example, we see xf3, which corresponds to the glyph ó, and is within the 128–255 range. \nIn Python, a Unicode string literal can be specified by preceding an ordinary string literal with a u, as in u'hello'. Arbitrary Unicode characters are defined using the $mathsf { backslash u X X X X }$ escape sequence inside a Unicode string literal. We find the integer ordinal of a character using ord(). For example: \n>>> ord('a') 97 \nThe hexadecimal four-digit notation for 97 is 0061, so we can define a Unicode string literal with the appropriate escape sequence: \n$> > > { textsf { a } } = { textsf { u } } ^ { prime } backslash { mathsf { u } } 0 0 6 1 ^ { prime }$   \n>>> a   \nu'a'   \n$gg >$ print a   \na \nNotice that the Python print statement is assuming a default encoding of the Unicode character, namely ASCII. However, $dot { mathsf n }$ is outside the ASCII range, so cannot be printed unless we specify an encoding. In the following example, we have specified that print should use the repr() of the string, which outputs the UTF-8 escape sequences (of the form xXX) rather than trying to render the glyphs. \n>>> nacute $mathbf { Psi } = mathbf { Psi } mathbf { u } ^ { prime } backslash cup 0 1 4 4 ^ { prime }$   \n>>> nacute   \nu'u0144'   \n>>> nacute_utf $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nacute.encode('utf8')   \n>>> print repr(nacute_utf)   \n'xc5x84' \nIf your operating system and locale are set up to render UTF-8 encoded characters, you ought to be able to give the Python command print nacute_utf and see $dot { mathsf { n } }$ on your screen. \nThere are many factors determining what glyphs are rendered on your screen. If you are sure that you have the correct encoding, but your Python code is still failing to produce the glyphs you expected, you should also check that you have the necessary fonts installed on your system. \nThe module unicodedata lets us inspect the properties of Unicode characters. In the following example, we select all characters in the third line of our Polish text outside the ASCII range and print their UTF-8 escaped value, followed by their code point integer using the standard Unicode convention (i.e., prefixing the hex digits with ${ mathsf { U } } + { mathsf { Omega } }$ ), followed by their Unicode name. \n>>> import unicodedata   \n>>> lines $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ codecs.open(path, encoding $vdots =$ 'latin2').readlines()   \n>>> line $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ lines[2]   \n>>> print line.encode('unicode_escape')   \nNiemcxf3w pod koniec II wojny u015bwiatowej na Dolny u015alu0105sk, zostau0142yn   \n>>> for c in line: if ord(c) > 127: print '%r U+%04x %s' % (c.encode('utf8'), ord(c), unicodedata.name(c))   \n'xc3xb3' U+00f3 LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH ACUTE   \n'xc5x9b' U+015b LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH ACUTE   \n'xc5x9a' U+015a LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S WITH ACUTE   \n'xc4x85' U+0105 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH OGONEK   \n'xc5x82' U+0142 LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH STROKE \nIf you replace the %r (which yields the repr() value) by $% s$ in the format string of the preceding code sample, and if your system supports UTF-8, you should see an output like the following: \nó U+00f3 LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH ACUTE ś U+015b LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH ACUTE Ś U+015a LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S WITH ACUTE $mathfrak { q }$ U+0105 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH OGONEK ł U+0142 LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH STROKE \n\nAlternatively, you may need to replace the encoding 'utf8' in the example by 'latin2', again depending on the details of your system. \nThe next examples illustrate how Python string methods and the re module accept Unicode strings. \n>>> line.find(u'zostau0142y')   \n54   \n>>> line $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ line.lower()   \n>>> print line.encode('unicode_escape')   \nniemcxf3w pod koniec ii wojny u015bwiatowej na dolny u015blu0105sk, zostau0142yn   \n>>> import re   \n>>> m $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ re.search(u'u015bw*', line)   \n>>> m.group()   \nu'u015bwiatowej' \nNLTK tokenizers allow Unicode strings as input, and correspondingly yield Unicode strings as output. \n>>> nltk.word_tokenize(line) [u'niemcxf3w', u'pod', u'koniec', u'ii', u'wojny', u'u015bwiatowej', u'na', u'dolny', u'u015blu0105sk', u'zostau0142y'] \nUsing Your Local Encoding in Python \nIf you are used to working with characters in a particular local encoding, you probably want to be able to use your standard methods for inputting and editing strings in a Python file. In order to do this, you need to include the string '# -*- coding: <coding> -*-' as the first or second line of your file. Note that <coding> has to be a string like 'latin-1', 'big5', or 'utf-8' (see Figure 3-4). \nFigure 3-4 also illustrates how regular expressions can use encoded strings. \n3.4  Regular Expressions for Detecting Word Patterns \nMany linguistic processing tasks involve pattern matching.

What do - and $^ +$ mean? \nLet’s explore the $^ +$ symbol a bit further. Notice that it can be applied to individual letters, or to bracketed sets of letters: \n>>> chat_words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sorted(set( $mathbf { Delta } _ { w }$ for w in nltk.corpus.nps_chat.words()))   \n>>> [w for w in chat_words if re.search('^m+i+n+e+$', w)]   \n['miiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeee', 'miiiiiinnnnnnnnnneeeeeeee', 'mine',   \n'mmmmmmmmiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnneeeeeeee']   \n>>> [w for w in chat_words if re.search('^[ha]+$', w)]   \n['a', 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa', 'aaahhhh', 'ah', 'ahah', 'ahahah', 'ahh',   \n'ahhahahaha', 'ahhh', 'ahhhh', 'ahhhhhh', 'ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh', 'h', 'ha', 'haaa',   \n'hah', 'haha', 'hahaaa', 'hahah', 'hahaha', 'hahahaa', 'hahahah', 'hahahaha', ...] \nIt should be clear that $^ +$ simply means “one or more instances of the preceding item,” which could be an individual character like m, a set like [fed], or a range like [d-f]. Now let’s replace $^ +$ with *, which means “zero or more instances of the preceding item.” The regular expression $kappa mathsf { m } ^ { ast } mathsf { i } ^ { ast } mathsf { n } ^ { ast } mathsf { e } ^ { ast } $ gg$ will match everything that we found using $ll uparrow mathsf { m } + dot { mathsf { 1 } }$ $+ n + e + $ 3$ , but also words where some of the letters don’t appear at all, e.g., me, min, and mmmmm. Note that the $^ +$ and * symbols are sometimes referred to as Kleene closures, or simply closures. \nThe ^ operator has another function when it appears as the first character inside square brackets. For example, «[^aeiouAEIOU]» matches any character other than a vowel. We can search the NPS Chat Corpus for words that are made up entirely of non-vowel characters using $ll [ looparrowleft. mathsf { a e i o u A E I O U } ] + $ $ gg $ to find items like these: :):):), grrr, cyb3r, and zzzzzzzz. Notice this includes non-alphabetic characters. \nHere are some more examples of regular expressions being used to find tokens that match a particular pattern, illustrating the use of some new symbols: $backslash , { }$ , (), and |. \nYour Turn: Study the previous examples and try to work out what the , {}, (), and | notations mean before you read on. \nYou probably worked out that a backslash means that the following character is deprived of its special powers and must literally match a specific character in the word. Thus, while . is special, . only matches a period. The braced expressions, like ${ 3 , 5 }$ , specify the number of repeats of the previous item. The pipe character indicates a choice between the material on its left or its right. Parentheses indicate the scope of an operator, and they can be used together with the pipe (or disjunction) symbol like this: $llangle mathsf { w } ( mathrm { i } | mathsf { e } | mathsf { a i } | mathsf { o o } ) mathrm { t } gg$ , matching wit, wet, wait, and woot. It is instructive to see what happens when you omit the parentheses from the last expression in the example, and search for $mathfrak { ll } mathsf { e d } | mathrm { i n g } $ mathfrak { H } rangle$ . \nThe metacharacters we have seen are summarized in Table 3-3. \nTo the Python interpreter, a regular expression is just like any other string. If the string contains a backslash followed by particular characters, it will interpret these specially. For example, b would be interpreted as the backspace character. In general, when using regular expressions containing backslash, we should instruct the interpreter not to look inside the string at all, but simply to pass it directly to the re library for processing. We do this by prefixing the string with the letter r, to indicate that it is a raw string. For example, the raw string r'bandb' contains two $mathsf { Omega } backslash mathsf { b }$ symbols that are interpreted by the re library as matching word boundaries instead of backspace characters. If you get into the habit of using r'...' for regular expressions—as we will do from now on—you will avoid having to think about these complications. \n3.5  Useful Applications of Regular Expressions \nThe previous examples all involved searching for words $boldsymbol { w }$ that match some regular expression regexp using re.search $( mathrm { r e g e x p , } ~ mathsf { w } )$ . Apart from checking whether a regular expression matches a word, we can use regular expressions to extract material from words, or to modify words in specific ways. \nExtracting Word Pieces \nThe re.findall() (“find all”) method finds all (non-overlapping) matches of the given regular expression. Let’s find all the vowels in a word, then count them: \n>>> word $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'   \n>>> re.findall(r'[aeiou]', word)   \n['u', 'e', 'a', 'i', 'a', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'e', 'i', o', 'i', 'o', 'u']   \n>>> len(re.findall(r'[aeiou]', word))   \n16 \nLet’s look for all sequences of two or more vowels in some text, and determine their relative frequency: \n>>> wsj $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sorted(set(nltk.corpus.treebank.words()))   \n>>> fd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FreqDist(vs for word in wsj for vs in re.findall(r'[aeiou]{2,}', word))   \n>>> fd.items()   \n[('io', 549), ('ea', 476), ('ie', 331), ('ou', 329), ('ai', 261), ('ia', 253),   \n('ee', 217), ('oo', 174), ('ua', 109), ('au', 106), ('ue', 105), ('ui', 95),   \n('ei', 86), ('oi', 65), ('oa', 59), ('eo', 39), ('iou', 27), ('eu', 18), ...] \nYour Turn: In the W3C Date Time Format, dates are represented like this: 2009-12-31. Replace the ? in the following Python code with a regular expression, in order to convert the string $cdot 2 0 0 9 - 1 2 - 3 1 cdot$ to a list of integers [2009, 12, 31]: \n[int(n) for n in re.findall(?, '2009-12-31')] \nDoing More with Word Pieces \nOnce we can use re.findall() to extract material from words, there are interesting things to do with the pieces, such as glue them back together or plot them. \nIt is sometimes noted that English text is highly redundant, and it is still easy to read when word-internal vowels are left out. For example, declaration becomes dclrtn, and inalienable becomes inlnble, retaining any initial or final vowel sequences. The regular expression in our next example matches initial vowel sequences, final vowel sequences, and all consonants; everything else is ignored. This three-way disjunction is processed left-to-right, and if one of the three parts matches the word, any later parts of the regular expression are ignored. We use re.findall() to extract all the matching pieces, and ''.join() to join them together (see Section 3.9 for more about the join operation).",

Here we will extract all consonant-vowel sequences from the words of Rotokas, such as $k a$ and si. Since each of these is a pair, it can be used to initialize a conditional frequency distribution. We then tabulate the frequency of each pair: \n>>> rotokas_words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.toolbox.words('rotokas.dic')   \n>>> cvs $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [cv for w in rotokas_words for cv in re.findall(r'[ptksvr][aeiou]', w)]   \n>>> cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(cvs)   \n>>> cfd.tabulate() a e i o u   \nk 418 148 94 420 173   \np 83 31 105 34 51   \nr 187 63 84 89 79   \ns 0 0 100 2 1   \nt 47 8 0 148 37   \nv 93 27 105 48 49 \nExamining the rows for $s$ and $t$ , we see they are in partial “complementary distribution,” which is evidence that they are not distinct phonemes in the language. Thus, we could conceivably drop s from the Rotokas alphabet and simply have a pronunciation rule that the letter $t$ is pronounced s when followed by i. (Note that the single entry having $s u$ , namely kasuari, ‘cassowary’ is borrowed from English). \nIf we want to be able to inspect the words behind the numbers in that table, it would be helpful to have an index, allowing us to quickly find the list of words that contains a given consonant-vowel pair. For example, cv_index['su'] should give us all words containing su. Here’s how we can do this: \n>>> cv_word_pairs $mathbf { Psi } = mathbf { Psi } left[ left( mathsf { c } mathbf { v } , begin{array} {} {} end{array} right. mathbf { w } right)$ for $w$ in rotokas_words for cv in re.findall(r'[ptksvr][aeiou]', w)]   \n>>> cv_index $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Index(cv_word_pairs)   \n>>> cv_index['su']   \n['kasuari']   \n>>> cv_index['po']   \n['kaapo', 'kaapopato', 'kaipori', 'kaiporipie', 'kaiporivira', 'kapo', 'kapoa',   \n'kapokao', 'kapokapo', 'kapokapo', 'kapokapoa', 'kapokapoa', 'kapokapora', ...] \nThis program processes each word $boldsymbol { mathsf { w } }$ in turn, and for each one, finds every substring that matches the regular expression $ll [ mathsf { p t k s v r } ] [ mathsf { a e i o u } ] ast$ . In the case of the word kasuari, it finds ka, su, and $r i$ . Therefore, the cv_word_pairs list will contain ('ka', 'ka suari'), ('su', 'kasuari'), and ('ri', 'kasuari'). One further step, using nltk.Index(), converts this into a useful index. \n\nFinding Word Stems \nWhen we use a web search engine, we usually don’t mind (or even notice) if the words in the document differ from our search terms in having different endings. A query for laptops finds documents containing laptop and vice versa. Indeed, laptop and laptops are just two forms of the same dictionary word (or lemma). For some language processing tasks we want to ignore word endings, and just deal with word stems. \nThere are various ways we can pull out the stem of a word. Here’s a simple-minded approach that just strips off anything that looks like a suffix: \n>>> def stem(word): for suffix in ['ing', 'ly', 'ed', 'ious', 'ies', 'ive', 'es', 's', 'ment']: if word.endswith(suffix): return word[:-len(suffix)] return word \nAlthough we will ultimately use NLTK’s built-in stemmers, it’s interesting to see how we can use regular expressions for this task. Our first step is to build up a disjunction of all the suffixes. We need to enclose it in parentheses in order to limit the scope of the disjunction. \n>>> re.findall(r'^.*(ing|ly|ed|ious|ies|ive|es|s|ment)$', 'processing') ['ing'] \nHere, re.findall() just gave us the suffix even though the regular expression matched the entire word. This is because the parentheses have a second function, to select substrings to be extracted. If we want to use the parentheses to specify the scope of the disjunction, but not to select the material to be output, we have to add ?:, which is just one of many arcane subtleties of regular expressions. Here’s the revised version. \n>>> re.findall(r'^.*(?:ing|ly|ed|ious|ies|ive|es|s|ment)$', 'processing') ['processing'] \nHowever, we’d actually like to split the word into stem and suffix. So we should just parenthesize both parts of the regular expression: \n>>> re.findall(r'^(.*)(ing|ly|ed|ious|ies|ive|es|s|ment)$', 'processing') [('process', 'ing')] \nThis looks promising, but still has a problem. Let’s look at a different word, processes: \n>>> re.findall(r'^(.*)(ing|ly|ed|ious|ies|ive|es|s|ment)$', 'processes') [('processe', 's')] \nThe regular expression incorrectly found an $- s$ suffix instead of an -es suffix. This demonstrates another subtlety: the star operator is “greedy” and so the .* part of the expression tries to consume as much of the input as possible. If we use the “non-greedy” version of the star operator, written $^ { * } ?$ , we get what we want:",

It produced some non-words, such as distribut and deriv, but these are acceptable stems in some applications. \nSearching Tokenized Text \nYou can use a special kind of regular expression for searching across multiple words in a text (where a text is a list of tokens). For example, \"<a> <man>\" finds all instances of a man in the text. The angle brackets are used to mark token boundaries, and any whitespace between the angle brackets is ignored (behaviors that are unique to NLTK’s findall() method for texts). In the following example, we include $mathbf {  < . Phi ^ { * } > 0 }$ , which will match any single token, and enclose it in parentheses so only the matched word (e.g., monied) and not the matched phrase (e.g., a monied man) is produced. The second example finds three-word phrases ending with the word bro $pmb { theta }$ . The last example finds sequences of three or more words starting with the letter $l Theta$ . \n>>> from nltk.corpus import gutenberg, nps_chat   \n>>> moby $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Text(gutenberg.words('melville-moby_dick.txt')) >>> moby.findall(r\"<a> (<.*>) <man>\")   \nmonied; nervous; dangerous; white; white; white; pious; queer; good; mature; white; Cape; great; wise; wise; butterless; white; fiendish; pale; furious; better; certain; complete; dismasted; younger; brave; brave; brave; brave   \n>>> chat $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Text(nps_chat.words())   \n>>> chat.findall(r\"<.*> <.*> <bro>\")   \nyou rule bro; telling you bro; u twizted bro",

For more practice, try some of the exercises on regular expressions at the end of this chapter. \nIt is easy to build search patterns when the linguistic phenomenon we’re studying is tied to particular words. In some cases, a little creativity will go a long way. For instance, searching a large text corpus for expressions of the form x and other ys allows us to discover hypernyms (see Section 2.5): \n>>> from nltk.corpus import brown   \n>>> hobbies_learned $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Text(brown.words(categories $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['hobbies', 'learned'])) >>> hobbies_learned.findall( $cdot ^ { prime prime } < backslash w ^ { * } >$ <and> <other> <w*s>\")   \nspeed and other activities; water and other liquids; tomb and other   \nlandmarks; Statues and other monuments; pearls and other jewels;   \ncharts and other items; roads and other features; figures and other   \nobjects; military and other areas; demands and other factors;   \nabstracts and other compilations; iron and other metals \nWith enough text, this approach would give us a useful store of information about the taxonomy of objects, without the need for any manual labor. However, our search results will usually contain false positives, i.e., cases that we would want to exclude. For example, the result demands and other factors suggests that demand is an instance of the type factor, but this sentence is actually about wage demands. Nevertheless, we could construct our own ontology of English concepts by manually correcting the output of such searches. \nThis combination of automatic and manual processing is the most common way for new corpora to be constructed. We will return to this in Chapter 11. \nSearching corpora also suffers from the problem of false negatives, i.e., omitting cases that we would want to include. It is risky to conclude that some linguistic phenomenon doesn’t exist in a corpus just because we couldn’t find any instances of a search pattern. Perhaps we just didn’t think carefully enough about suitable patterns. \nYour Turn: Look for instances of the pattern as x as y to discover information about entities and their properties. \n3.6  Normalizing Text \nIn earlier program examples we have often converted text to lowercase before doing anything with its words, e.g., set(w.lower() for $w$ in text). By using lower(), we have normalized the text to lowercase so that the distinction between The and the is ignored. Often we want to go further than this and strip off any affixes, a task known as stemming. A further step is to make sure that the resulting form is a known word in a dictionary, a task known as lemmatization. We discuss each of these in turn. First, we need to define the data we will use in this section: \n>>> raw $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"\"\"DENNIS: Listen, strange women lying in ponds distributing swords . is no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from . a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.\" 1 11 1 >>> tokens $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.word_tokenize(raw) \nStemmers \nNLTK includes several off-the-shelf stemmers, and if you ever need a stemmer, you should use one of these in preference to crafting your own using regular expressions, since NLTK’s stemmers handle a wide range of irregular cases. The Porter and Lancaster stemmers follow their own rules for stripping affixes. Observe that the Porter stemmer correctly handles the word lying (mapping it to lie), whereas the Lancaster stemmer does not. \n>>> porter $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.PorterStemmer()   \n>>> lancaster $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.LancasterStemmer()   \n>>> [porter.stem(t) for t in tokens]   \n['DENNI', 'Listen', ',', 'strang', 'women', 'lie', 'in', 'pond',   \n'distribut', 'sword', 'is', 'no', 'basi', 'for', 'a', 'system', 'of', 'govern', 'Suprem', 'execut', 'power', 'deriv', 'from', 'a', 'mandat', 'from',   \n'the', 'mass', 'not', 'from', 'some', 'farcic', 'aquat', 'ceremoni', '.']   \n>>> [lancaster.stem(t) for t in tokens]   \n['den', 'list', 'strange', 'wom', 'lying', 'in', 'pond', 'distribut',   \n'sword', 'is', 'no', 'bas', 'for', 'a', 'system', 'of', 'govern', suprem'   \n'execut', 'pow', 'der' 'from', 'a', 'mand', 'from', 'the', 'mass' ， 'not',   \n'from', 'som', 'farc', 'aqu', 'ceremony', '] \nStemming is not a well-defined process, and we typically pick the stemmer that best suits the application we have in mind. The Porter Stemmer is a good choice if you are indexing some texts and want to support search using alternative forms of words (illustrated in Example 3-1, which uses object-oriented programming techniques that are outside the scope of this book, string formatting techniques to be covered in Section 3.9, and the enumerate() function to be explained in Section 4.2). \nExample 3-1.

Although it is a fundamental task, we have been able to delay it until now because many corpora are already tokenized, and because NLTK includes some tokenizers. Now that you are familiar with regular expressions, you can learn how to use them to tokenize text, and to have much more control over the process. \nSimple Approaches to Tokenization \nThe very simplest method for tokenizing text is to split on whitespace. Consider the following text from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland: \n>>> raw $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"\"\"'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone . though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very .. well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'...\"\"\" \nWe could split this raw text on whitespace using raw.split(). To do the same using a regular expression, it is not enough to match any space characters in the string $bullet$ , since this results in tokens that contain a n newline character; instead, we need to match any number of spaces, tabs, or newlines $pmb { theta }$ : \nThe regular expression $kappa [ { bf Phi } backslash { { sf backslash n } ] + gg $ matches one or more spaces, tabs (t), or newlines (n). Other whitespace characters, such as carriage return and form feed, should really be included too. Instead, we will use a built-in re abbreviation, s, which means any whitespace character. The second statement in the preceding example can be rewritten as re.split $( boldsymbol { mathbf { r } } ^ { prime } backslash backslash boldsymbol { mathbf { mathit { s } } } + ^ { prime }$ , raw). \nImportant: Remember to prefix regular expressions with the letter r (meaning “raw”), which instructs the Python interpreter to treat the string literally, rather than processing any backslashed characters it contains. \nSplitting on whitespace gives us tokens like '(not' and 'herself,'. An alternative is to use the fact that Python provides us with a character class $ W$ for word characters, equivalent to $[ mathsf { a - z A - Z 0 - 9 _ { - } } ]$ . It also defines the complement of this class, W, i.e., all characters other than letters, digits, or underscore. We can use W in a simple regular expression to split the input on anything other than a word character:",

With re.findall $( mathbf { r } ^ { prime } backslash w + ^ { prime } ,  r a w )$ , we get the same tokens, but without the empty strings, using a pattern that matches the words instead of the spaces. Now that we’re matching the words, we’re in a position to extend the regular expression to cover a wider range of cases. The regular expression $ll vert w + 1 vert setminus zeta backslash w ^ { * } gg $ will first try to match any sequence of word characters. If no match is found, it will try to match any non-whitespace character (S is the complement of s) followed by further word characters. This means that punctuation is grouped with any following letters (e.g., ’s) but that sequences of two or more punctuation characters are separated. \n>>> re.findall $( gamma ^ { prime } backslash w + 1 ) backslash 5 backslash w ^ { * } ^ { prime }$ , raw)   \n[\"'When\", 'I', \"'M\", 'a', 'Duchess', she' 'said', 'to', 'herself', '(not', 'in', 'a', 'very 'hopeful', 'tone', 'though 'won', \"'t\" 'have', 'any', 'pepper', 'in', 'my', 'kitchen' AT 'ALL 'Soup', 'does', 'very', 'well', 'without', -Maybe it 'always' pepper', 'that', 'makes', 'people', 'hot', '-tempered' \nLet’s generalize the $backslash w +$ in the preceding expression to permit word-internal hyphens and apostrophes: $llbackslash vert w + ( [ - ^ { prime } ] backslash w + ) ^ { ast } gg .$ This expression means $backslash w +$ followed by zero or more instances of $[ - ^ { prime } ] backslash w +$ ; it would match hot-tempered and it’s. (We need to include ?: in this expression for reasons discussed earlier.) We’ll also add a pattern to match quote characters so these are kept separate from the text they enclose. \nThe expression in this example also included $ll [ - . ( ] + gg$ , which causes the double hyphen, ellipsis, and open parenthesis to be tokenized separately. \nTable 3-4 lists the regular expression character class symbols we have seen in this section, in addition to some other useful symbols. \nNLTK’s Regular Expression Tokenizer \nThe function nltk.regexp_tokenize() is similar to re.findall() (as we’ve been using it for tokenization).

Before tokenizing the text into words, we need to segment it into sentences. NLTK facilitates this by including the Punkt sentence segmenter (Kiss & Strunk, 2006). Here is an example of its use in segmenting the text of a novel. (Note that if the segmenter’s internal data has been updated by the time you read this, you will see different output.) \n>>> sent_tokenizer=nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')   \n>>> text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.gutenberg.raw('chesterton-thursday.txt')   \n>>> sents $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sent_tokenizer.tokenize(text)   \n>>> pprint.pprint(sents[171:181])   \n['\"Nonsense!', \" said Gregory, who was very rational when anyone elsenattempted paradox.', '\"Why do all the clerks and navvies in thenrailway trains look so sad and tired,.

However, the quoted speech contains several sentences, and these have been split into individual strings. This is reasonable behavior for most applications. \nSentence segmentation is difficult because a period is used to mark abbreviations, and some periods simultaneously mark an abbreviation and terminate a sentence, as often happens with acronyms like U.S.A. \nFor another approach to sentence segmentation, see Section 6.2. \nWord Segmentation \nFor some writing systems, tokenizing text is made more difficult by the fact that there is no visual representation of word boundaries. For example, in Chinese, the threecharacter string: 爱国人 (ai4 “love” [verb], guo3 “country”, ren2 “person”) could be tokenized as 爱国 / 人, “country-loving person,” or as 爱 / 国人, “love country-person.” \nA similar problem arises in the processing of spoken language, where the hearer must segment a continuous speech stream into individual words. A particularly challenging version of this problem arises when we don’t know the words in advance. This is the problem faced by a language learner, such as a child hearing utterances from a parent. Consider the following artificial example, where word boundaries have been removed: \n(1) a. doyouseethekitty b. seethedoggy c. doyoulikethekitty d. likethedoggy \nOur first challenge is simply to represent the problem: we need to find a way to separate text content from the segmentation. We can do this by annotating each character with a boolean value to indicate whether or not a word-break appears after the character (an idea that will be used heavily for “chunking” in Chapter 7). Let’s assume that the learner is given the utterance breaks, since these often correspond to extended pauses. Here is a possible representation, including the initial and target segmentations: \n>>> text $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ \"doyouseethekittyseethedoggydoyoulikethekittylikethedoggy\" >>> seg1 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ \"0000000000000001000000000010000000000000000100000000000\" >>> seg2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ \"0100100100100001001001000010100100010010000100010010000\" \nObserve that the segmentation strings consist of zeros and ones. They are one character shorter than the source text, since a text of length n can be broken up in only n–1 places. The segment() function in Example 3-2 demonstrates that we can get back to the original segmented text from its representation.",

They are one character shorter than the source text, since a text of length n can be broken up in only n–1 places. The segment() function in Example 3-2 demonstrates that we can get back to the original segmented text from its representation. \nExample 3-2. Reconstruct segmented text from string representation: seg1 and seg2 represent the initial and final segmentations of some hypothetical child-directed speech; the segment() function can use them to reproduce the segmented text. \ndef segment(text, segs): words $mathbf { mu } = left[ begin{array} { l l l } end{array} right]$ last $mathbf { varepsilon } = mathbf { varepsilon } _ { 0 }$ for i in range(len(segs)): if segs[i] $mathbf { Psi } = mathbf { Psi } ^ { bullet } mathbf { Psi } ^ { bullet }$ : words.append(text[last:i+1]) last $mathbf { Psi } = mathbf { dot { 1 } } mathbf { + } mathbf { 1 }$ words.append(text[last:]) return words   \n>>> text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"doyouseethekittyseethedoggydoyoulikethekittylikethedoggy\"   \n>>> seg1 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ \"0000000000000001000000000010000000000000000100000000000\"   \n$gg >$ seg2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"0100100100100001001001000010100100010010000100010010000\"   \n>>> segment(text, seg1)   \n['doyouseethekitty', 'seethedoggy', 'doyoulikethekitty', 'likethedoggy']   \n>>> segment(text, seg2)   \n['do', 'you', 'see', 'the', 'kitty', 'see', 'the', 'doggy', 'do', 'you',   \n'like', 'the', kitty', 'like', 'the', 'doggy'] \nNow the segmentation task becomes a search problem: find the bit string that causes the text string to be correctly segmented into words. We assume the learner is acquiring words and storing them in an internal lexicon. Given a suitable lexicon, it is possible to reconstruct the source text as a sequence of lexical items. Following (Brent & Cartwright, 1995), we can define an objective function, a scoring function whose value we will try to optimize, based on the size of the lexicon and the amount of information needed to reconstruct the source text from the lexicon. We illustrate this in Figure 3-6. \nIt is a simple matter to implement this objective function, as shown in Example 3-3. \nExample 3-3. Computing the cost of storing the lexicon and reconstructing the source text. \ndef evaluate(text, segs): words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ segment(text, segs) text_size $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(words) lexicon_size $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(' '.join(list(set(words)))) return text_size $^ +$ lexicon_size   \n>>> text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"doyouseethekittyseethedoggydoyoulikethekittylikethedoggy\"   \n>>> seg1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"0000000000000001000000000010000000000000000100000000000\"   \n>>> seg2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"0100100100100001001001000010100100010010000100010010000\"   \n>>> seg3 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"0000100100000011001000000110000100010000001100010000001\"   \n>>> segment(text, seg3)   \n['doyou', 'see', 'thekitt', 'y', 'see', 'thedogg', 'y', 'doyou', 'like',   \n'thekitt', 'y', 'like', 'thedogg', 'y']   \n>>> evaluate(text, seg3)   \n46   \n>>> evaluate(text, seg2)   \n47   \n>>> evaluate(text, seg1)   \n63 \nThe final step is to search for the pattern of zeros and ones that maximizes this objective function, shown in Example 3-4. Notice that the best segmentation includes “words” like thekitty, since there’s not enough evidence in the data to split this any further. \nExample 3-4. Non-deterministic search using simulated annealing: Begin searching with phrase segmentations only; randomly perturb the zeros and ones proportional to the “temperature”; with each iteration the temperature is lowered and the perturbation of boundaries is reduced. \nfrom random import randint \ndef flip(segs, pos): return segs[:pos] $^ +$ str(1-int(segs[pos])) $^ +$ segs[pos+1:]   \ndef flip_n(segs, n): for i in range(n): segs $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ flip(segs, randint(0,len(segs)-1)) return segs   \ndef anneal(text, segs, iterations, cooling_rate): temperature $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ float(len(segs)) while temperature > 0.5: best_segs, best $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ segs, evaluate(text, segs) for i in range(iterations): guess $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ flip_n(segs, int(round(temperature))) score $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ evaluate(text, guess) if score $angle cdot angle$ best: best, best_segs $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ score, guess score, segs $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ best, best_segs temperature $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ temperature / cooling_rate print evaluate(text, segs), segment(text, segs) \nprint return segs \n>>> text $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ \"doyouseethekittyseethedoggydoyoulikethekittylikethedoggy\"   \n>>> seg1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"0000000000000001000000000010000000000000000100000000000\"   \n>>> anneal(text, seg1, 5000, 1.2)   \n60 ['doyouseetheki', 'tty', 'see', 'thedoggy', 'doyouliketh', 'ekittylike', 'thedoggy']   \n58 ['doy', 'ouseetheki', 'ttysee', 'thedoggy', 'doy', 'o', 'ulikethekittylike', 'thedoggy']   \n56 ['doyou', 'seetheki', 'ttysee', 'thedoggy', 'doyou', 'liketh', 'ekittylike', 'thedoggy']   \n54 ['doyou', 'seethekit', 'tysee', 'thedoggy' , 'doyou', 'likethekittylike', 'thedoggy']   \n53 ['doyou', 'seethekit', 'tysee', 'thedoggy', 'doyou', 'like', 'thekitty', 'like', 'thedoggy']   \n51 ['doyou', 'seethekittysee', 'thedoggy', 'doyou', 'like', 'thekitty', 'like', 'thedoggy']   \n42 ['doyou', 'see', 'thekitty', 'see', 'thedoggy', 'doyou', 'like', 'thekitty', 'like', 'thedoggy']   \n'0000100100000001001000000010000100010000000100010000000' \nWith enough data, it is possible to automatically segment text into words with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Such methods can be applied to tokenization for writing systems that don’t have any visual representation of word boundaries. \n3.9  Formatting: From Lists to Strings \nOften we write a program to report a single data item, such as a particular element in a corpus that meets some complicated criterion, or a single summary statistic such as a word-count or the performance of a tagger. More often, we write a program to produce a structured result; for example, a tabulation of numbers or linguistic forms, or a reformatting of the original data. When the results to be presented are linguistic, textual output is usually the most natural choice. However, when the results are numerical, it may be preferable to produce graphical output. In this section, you will learn about a variety of ways to present program output. \nFrom Lists to Strings \nThe simplest kind of structured object we use for text processing is lists of words. When we want to output these to a display or a file, we must convert these lists into strings. To do this in Python we use the join() method, and specify the string to be used as the “glue”: \n>>> silly $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['We', 'called', 'him', 'Tortoise', 'because', 'he', 'taught', 'us', '.'] >>> ' '.join(silly)   \n'We called him Tortoise because he taught us .   \n>>> ';'.join(silly)   \n'We;called;him;Tortoise;because;he;taught;us;.'   \n>>> ''.join(silly)   \n'WecalledhimTortoisebecausehetaughtus.' \nSo ' '.join(silly) means: take all the items in silly and concatenate them as one big string, using ' ' as a spacer between the items. I.e., join() is a method of the string that you want to use as the glue. (Many people find this notation for join() counterintuitive.) The join() method only works on a list of strings—what we have been calling a text—a complex type that enjoys some privileges in Python.",

To do this in Python we use the join() method, and specify the string to be used as the “glue”: \n>>> silly $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['We', 'called', 'him', 'Tortoise', 'because', 'he', 'taught', 'us', '.'] >>> ' '.join(silly)   \n'We called him Tortoise because he taught us .   \n>>> ';'.join(silly)   \n'We;called;him;Tortoise;because;he;taught;us;.'   \n>>> ''.join(silly)   \n'WecalledhimTortoisebecausehetaughtus.' \nSo ' '.join(silly) means: take all the items in silly and concatenate them as one big string, using ' ' as a spacer between the items. I.e., join() is a method of the string that you want to use as the glue. (Many people find this notation for join() counterintuitive.) The join() method only works on a list of strings—what we have been calling a text—a complex type that enjoys some privileges in Python. \nStrings and Formats \nWe have seen that there are two ways to display the contents of an object: \n>>> word $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'cat'   \n>>> sentence $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ \"\"\"hello   \n... world\"\"\"   \n>>> print word   \ncat   \n>>> print sentence   \nhello   \nworld   \n>>> word   \n'cat'   \n>>> sentence   \n'hellonworld' \nThe print command yields Python’s attempt to produce the most human-readable form of an object. The second method—naming the variable at a prompt—shows us a string that can be used to recreate this object. It is important to keep in mind that both of these are just strings, displayed for the benefit of you, the user. They do not give us any clue as to the actual internal representation of the object. \nThere are many other useful ways to display an object as a string of characters. This may be for the benefit of a human reader, or because we want to export our data to a particular file format for use in an external program. \nFormatted output typically contains a combination of variables and pre-specified strings. For example, given a frequency distribution fdist, we could do: \n>>> fdist $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FreqDist(['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'snake', 'dog', 'cat'])   \n>>> for word in fdist: print word, '->', fdist[word], ';',   \ndog -> 4 ; cat -> 3 ; snake -> 1 ; \nApart from the problem of unwanted whitespace, print statements that contain alternating variables and constants can be difficult to read and maintain. A better solution is to use string formatting expressions. \n>>> for word in fdist: print '%s->%d;' % (word, fdist[word]),   \ndog->4; cat->3; snake->1; \nTo understand what is going on here, let’s test out the string formatting expression on its own. (By now this will be your usual method of exploring new syntax.) \n>>> '%s->%d;' % ('cat', 3)   \n'cat->3;'   \n>>> '%s->%d;' % 'cat'   \nTraceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>   \nTypeError: not enough arguments for format string",

Here’s an example using a for loop: \n>>> template $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Lee wants a %s right now'   \n$gg >$ menu $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['sandwich', 'spam fritter', 'pancake']   \n$gg >$ for snack in menu: print template % snack   \nLee wants a sandwich right now   \nLee wants a spam fritter right now   \nLee wants a pancake right now \nThe $% s$ and $% d$ symbols are called conversion specifiers.

Since the percent character $%$ has a special interpretation in formatting strings, we have to precede it with another $%$ to get it in the output. \n>>> count, total $= 3 2 0 5$ , 9375   \n>>> \"accuracy for %d words: %2.4f%%\" % (total, 100 $^ *$ count / total)   \n'accuracy for 9375 words: 34.1867%' \nAn important use of formatting strings is for tabulating data. Recall that in Section 2.1 we saw data being tabulated from a conditional frequency distribution. Let’s perform the tabulation ourselves, exercising full control of headings and column widths, as shown in Example 3-5. Note the clear separation between the language processing work, and the tabulation of results. \nExample 3-5. Frequency of modals in different sections of the Brown Corpus. \ndef tabulate(cfdist, words, categories): print '%-16s' % 'Category', for word in words: # column headings print '%6s' % word, print for category in categories: print $1 % - 1 6 5 ^ { cdot } %$ category, # row heading for word in words: # for each word print '%6d' % cfdist[category][word], # print table cell print # end the row   \n>>> from nltk.corpus import brown   \n>>> cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist( (genre, word) for genre in brown.categories() for word in brown.words(categories=genre))   \n>>> genres $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['news', 'religion', 'hobbies', 'science_fiction', 'romance', 'humor']   \n>>> modals $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['can', 'could', 'may', 'might', 'must', 'will']   \n>>> tabulate(cfd, modals, genres)   \nCategory can could may might must will   \nnews 93 86 66 38 50 389   \nreligion 82 59 78 12 54 71   \nhobbies 268 58 131 22 83 264   \nscience_fiction 16 49 4 12 8 16   \nromance 74 193 11 51 45 43   \nhumor 16 30 8 8 9 13 \nRecall from the listing in Example 3-1 that we used a formatting string $\" % ^ { * } { sf S } \"$ . This allows us to specify the width of a field using a variable. \n>>> '%*s' % (15, \"Monty Python\") Monty Python' \nWe could use this to automatically customize the column to be just wide enough to accommodate all the words, using width $mathbf { Omega } = mathsf { m a x } ( mathsf { l e n } ( mathsf { w } )$ for w in words). Remember that the comma at the end of print statements adds an extra space, and this is sufficient to prevent the column headings from running into each other. \nWriting Results to a File \nWe have seen how to read text from files (Section 3.1). It is often useful to write output to files as well. The following code opens a file output.txt for writing, and saves the program output to the file. \n>>> output_file $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ open('output.txt', 'w')   \n>>> words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ set(nltk.corpus.genesis.words('english-kjv.txt'))   \n>>> for word in sorted(words): output_file.write(word + \"n\") \nYour Turn: What is the effect of appending n to each string before we write it to the file? If you’re using a Windows machine, you may want to use word $mathbf { nabla } + mathbf { nabla } \" mathbf { left. { mathbf { r } } right. } mathbf { n } \"$ instead. What happens if we do \noutput_file.write(word) \nWhen we write non-text data to a file, we must convert it to a string first. We can do this conversion using formatting strings, as we saw earlier. Let’s write the total number of words to our file, before closing it. \n>>> len(words)   \n2789   \n>>> str(len(words))   \n'2789'   \n>>> output_file.write( $langle s t r ( mathrm { l e n } ( mathsf { w o r d s } ) )  +  \" langle mathsf { n } \" )$   \n>>> output_file.close() \nCaution! \nYou should avoid filenames that contain space characters, such as output file.txt, or that are identical except for case distinctions, e.g., Output.txt and output.TXT. \nText Wrapping \nWhen the output of our program is text-like, instead of tabular, it will usually be necessary to wrap it so that it can be displayed conveniently. Consider the following output, which overflows its line, and which uses a complicated print statement: \n>>> saying $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['After', 'all', 'is', 'said', 'and', 'done', 'more', 'is', 'said', 'than', 'done', '.']   \n>>> for word in saying: print word, $bar  bar { ( bar { mathbf { nu } } + mathbf { nu } _ { 5 } mathrm { t r } ( mathrm { l e n } ( mathsf { w o r d } ) )  +  bar { mathbf { nu } } ^ { prime } ) , }$ ',   \nAfter (5), all (3), is (2), said (4), and (3), done (4), , (1), more (4), is (2), said (4), \nWe can take care of line wrapping with the help of Python’s textwrap module. For maximum clarity we will separate each step onto its own line: \n>>> from textwrap import fill >>> format $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ '%s (%d),'",

A single determiner (assume that a, an, and the are the only determiners) b. An arithmetic expression using integers, addition, and multiplication, such as $2 ^ { ast } 3 ast 8$ \n8. ○ Write a utility function that takes a URL as its argument, and returns the contents of the URL, with all HTML markup removed. Use urllib.urlopen to access the contents of the URL, e.g.: \nraw_contents $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ urllib.urlopen('http://www.nltk.org/').read() \n9. $bigcirc$ Save some text into a file corpus.txt. Define a function load(f) that reads from the file named in its sole argument, and returns a string containing the text of the file. \na. Use nltk.regexp_tokenize() to create a tokenizer that tokenizes the various kinds of punctuation in this text. Use one multiline regular expression inline comments, using the verbose flag (?x).   \nb. Use nltk.regexp_tokenize() to create a tokenizer that tokenizes the following kinds of expressions: monetary amounts; dates; names of people and organizations. \n10. ○ Rewrite the following loop as a list comprehension: \n>>> sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']   \n>>> result $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ []   \n>>> for word in sent: word_len $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ (word, len(word)) result.append(word_len)   \n>>> result   \n[('The', 3), ('dog', 3), ('gave', 4), ('John', 4), ('the', 3), \n11. ○ Define a string raw containing a sentence of your own choosing. Now, split raw on some character other than space, such as 's'. \n12. ○ Write a for loop to print out the characters of a string, one per line. \n13. ○ What is the difference between calling split on a string with no argument and one with ' ' as the argument, e.g., sent.split() versus sent.split(' ')? What happens when the string being split contains tab characters, consecutive space characters, or a sequence of tabs and spaces? (In IDLE you will need to use 't' to enter a tab character.) \n14. ○ Create a variable words containing a list of words. Experiment with words.sort() and sorted(words). What is the difference? \n15. $bigcirc$ Explore the difference between strings and integers by typing the following at a Python prompt: \"3\" * 7 and $3 * 7$ . Try converting between strings and integers using int(\"3\") and str(3). \n16. ○ Earlier, we asked you to use a text editor to create a file called test.py, containing the single line monty $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Monty Python'. If you haven’t already done this (or can’t find the file), go ahead and do it now. Next, start up a new session with the Python interpreter, and enter the expression monty at the prompt. You will get an error from the interpreter. Now, try the following (note that you have to leave off the .py part of the filename): \n\n>>> from test import msg >>> msg \nThis time, Python should return with a value. You can also try import test, in \nwhich case Python should be able to evaluate the expression test.monty at the prompt.   \n17. ○ What happens when the formatting strings $% 6 s$ and $% - 6 s$ are used to display strings that are longer than six characters?   \n18. ◑ Read in some text from a corpus, tokenize it, and print the list of all wh-word types that occur. (wh-words in English are used in questions, relative clauses, and exclamations: who, which, what, and so on.) Print them in order. Are any words duplicated in this list, because of the presence of case distinctions or punctuation?   \n19. ◑ Create a file consisting of words and (made up) frequencies, where each line consists of a word, the space character, and a positive integer, e.g., fuzzy 53. Read the file into a Python list using open(filename).readlines(). Next, break each line into its two fields using split(), and convert the number into an integer using int(). The result should be a list of the form: [['fuzzy', 53], ...].   \n20. ◑ Write code to access a favorite web page and extract some text from it. For example, access a weather site and extract the forecast top temperature for your town or city today.   \n21. ◑ Write a function unknown() that takes a URL as its argument, and returns a list of unknown words that occur on that web page. In order to do this, extract all substrings consisting of lowercase letters (using re.findall()) and remove any items from this set that occur in the Words Corpus (nltk.corpus.words). Try to categorize these words manually and discuss your findings.   \n22. $mathbf { 0 }$ Examine the results of processing the URL http://news.bbc.co.uk/ using the regular expressions suggested above. You will see that there is still a fair amount of non-textual data there, particularly JavaScript commands. You may also find that sentence breaks have not been properly preserved. Define further regular expressions that improve the extraction of text from this web page.   \n23. $mathbf { 0 }$ Are you able to write a regular expression to tokenize text in such a way that the word don’t is tokenized into do and n’t? Explain why this regular expression won’t work: «n't $| backslash { w + gg }$ .   \n24. $mathbf { 0 }$ Try to write code to convert text into $h A c k 3 r$ , using regular expressions and substitution, where $mathbf { e }  3$ , $mathbf { i } to 1$ , $mathbf { 0 }  mathbf { 0 }$ , $mathbf { epsilon } mathbf { 1 }  mathbf { epsilon } |$ , $s to 5$ , . $ 5 w 3 3  t !$ , ate $ 8$ . Normalize the text to lowercase before converting it. Add more substitutions of your own. Now try to map s to two different values: $$ 1$ for word-initial s, and 5 for wordinternal s. \n25. ◑ Pig Latin is a simple transformation of English text. Each word of the text is converted as follows: move any consonant (or consonant cluster) that appears at the start of the word to the end, then append ay, e.g., string $mid  mid$ ingstray, idle $mid  mid$ idleay (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin). \na. Write a function to convert a word to Pig Latin.   \nb. Write code that converts text, instead of individual words.   \nc. Extend it further to preserve capitalization, to keep qu together (so that quiet becomes ietquay, for example), and to detect when y is used as a consonant (e.g., yellow) versus a vowel (e.g., style). \n26. ◑ Download some text from a language that has vowel harmony (e.g., Hungarian), extract the vowel sequences of words, and create a vowel bigram table. \n27. ◑ Python’s random module includes a function choice() which randomly chooses an item from a sequence; e.g., choice(\"aehh \") will produce one of four possible characters, with the letter h being twice as frequent as the others. Write a generator expression that produces a sequence of 500 randomly chosen letters drawn from the string \"aehh \", and put this expression inside a call to the ''.join() function, to concatenate them into one long string. You should get a result that looks like uncontrolled sneezing or maniacal laughter: he haha ee heheeh eha. Use split() and join() again to normalize the whitespace in this string. \n28. $mathbf { 0 }$ Consider the numeric expressions in the following sentence from the MedLine Corpus: The corresponding free cortisol fractions in these sera were $4 . 5 3 + / - 0 . 1 5 %$ and $8 . 1 6 + / - 0 . 2 3 %$ , respectively. Should we say that the numeric expression 4.53 $+ / - 0 . 1 5 %$ is three words? Or should we say that it’s a single compound word? Or should we say that it is actually nine words, since it’s read “four point five three, plus or minus fifteen percent”? Or should we say that it’s not a “real” word at all, since it wouldn’t appear in any dictionary? Discuss these different possibilities. Can you think of application domains that motivate at least two of these answers? \n29. $mathbf { 0 }$ Readability measures are used to score the reading difficulty of a text, for the purposes of selecting texts of appropriate difficulty for language learners. Let us define $mu _ { mathrm { w } }$ to be the average number of letters per word, and ${ mu } _ { mathrm { s } }$ to be the average number of words per sentence, in a given text. The Automated Readability Index (ARI) of the text is defined to be: $4 . 7 1 mu _ { w } + 0 . 5 mu _ { s } - 2 1 . 4 3$ . Compute the ARI score for various sections of the Brown Corpus, including section $mathsf { f }$ (popular lore) and j (learned). Make use of the fact that nltk.corpus.brown.words() produces a sequence of words, whereas nltk.corpus.brown.sents() produces a sequence of sentences. \n30. $mathbf { 0 }$ Use the Porter Stemmer to normalize some tokenized text, calling the stemmer on each word. Do the same thing with the Lancaster Stemmer, and see if you observe any differences. \n31. ◑ Define the variable saying to contain the list ['After', 'all', 'is', 'said', 'and', 'done', ',', 'more', 'is', 'said', 'than', 'done', '.']. Process the list using a for loop, and store the result in a new list lengths. Hint: begin by assigning the empty list to lengths, using lengths $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma } [ mathbf { Sigma } ]$ . Then each time through the loop, use append() to add another length value to the list. \n\n32. ◑ Define a variable silly to contain the string: 'newly formed bland ideas are inexpressible in an infuriating way'. (This happens to be the legitimate interpretation that bilingual English-Spanish speakers can assign to Chomsky’s famous nonsense phrase colorless green ideas sleep furiously, according to Wikipedia). Now write code to perform the following tasks: \na. Split silly into a list of strings, one per word, using Python’s split() operation, and save this to a variable called bland.   \nb. Extract the second letter of each word in silly and join them into a string, to get 'eoldrnnnna'.   \nc. Combine the words in bland back into a single string, using join(). Make sure the words in the resulting string are separated with whitespace.   \nd. Print the words of silly in alphabetical order, one per line. \n33. ◑ The index() function can be used to look up items in sequences. For example, 'inexpressible'.index('e') tells us the index of the first position of the letter e. \na. What happens when you look up a substring, e.g., 'inexpressi ble'.index('re')?   \nb. Define a variable words containing a list of words. Now use words.index() to look up the position of an individual word.   \nc. Define a variable silly as in Exercise 32. Use the index() function in combination with list slicing to build a list phrase consisting of all the words up to (but not including) in in silly. \n34. ◑ Write code to convert nationality adjectives such as Canadian and Australian to their corresponding nouns Canada and Australia (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ List_of_adjectival_forms_of_place_names). \n35. $mathbf { 0 }$ Read the LanguageLog post on phrases of the form as best as p can and as best $p$ can, where $p$ is a pronoun. Investigate this phenomenon with the help of a corpus and the findall() method for searching tokenized text described in Section 3.5. The post is at http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002733.html. \n36. $mathbf { 0 }$ Study the lolcat version of the book of Genesis, accessible as nltk.corpus.gene sis.words('lolcat.txt'), and the rules for converting text into lolspeak at http:// www.lolcatbible.com/index.php?title $vDash$ How_to_speak_lolcat. Define regular expressions to convert English words into corresponding lolspeak words. \n37. ◑ Read about the re.sub() function for string substitution using regular expressions, using help(re.sub) and by consulting the further readings for this chapter. Use re.sub in writing code to remove HTML tags from an HTML file, and to normalize whitespace. \n38. $bullet$ An interesting challenge for tokenization is words that have been split across a linebreak. E.g., if long-term is split, then we have the string long-nterm. \na. Write a regular expression that identifies words that are hyphenated at a linebreak. The expression will need to include the n character. b. Use re.sub() to remove the n character from these words. c. How might you identify words that should not remain hyphenated once the newline is removed, e.g., 'encyclo-npedia'? \n39. ● Read the Wikipedia entry on Soundex. Implement this algorithm in Python. \n40. $bullet$ Obtain raw texts from two or more genres and compute their respective reading difficulty scores as in the earlier exercise on reading difficulty. E.g., compare ABC Rural News and ABC Science News (nltk.corpus.abc). Use Punkt to perform sentence segmentation. \n41. $bullet$ Rewrite the following nested loop as a nested list comprehension: \n>>> words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['attribution', 'confabulation', 'elocution', 'sequoia', 'tenacious', 'unidirectional']   \n>>> vsequences $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ set()   \n>>> for word in words: vowels $mathbf { mu } = left[ begin{array} { l l l } end{array} right]$ for char in word: if char in 'aeiou': vowels.append(char) vsequences.add(''.join(vowels))   \n>>> sorted(vsequences)   \n['aiuio', 'eaiou', 'eouio', 'euoia', 'oauaio', 'uiieioa']   \n42. ● Use WordNet to create a semantic index for a text collection. Extend the concordance search program in Example 3-1, indexing each word using the offset of its first synset, e.g., wn.synsets('dog')[0].offset (and optionally the offset of some of its ancestors in the hypernym hierarchy).   \n43. ● With the help of a multilingual corpus such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Corpus (nltk.corpus.udhr), along with NLTK’s frequency distribution and rank correlation functionality (nltk.FreqDist, nltk.spearman_correla tion), develop a system that guesses the language of a previously unseen text. For simplicity, work with a single character encoding and just a few languages.   \n44. ● Write a program that processes a text and discovers cases where a word has been used with a novel sense. For each word, compute the WordNet similarity between all synsets of the word and all synsets of the words in its context. (Note that this is a crude approach; doing it well is a difficult, open research problem.)   \n45. $bullet$ Read the article on normalization of non-standard words (Sproat et al., 2001), and implement a similar system for text normalization. \n\nWriting Structured Programs \nBy now you will have a sense of the capabilities of the Python programming language for processing natural language. However, if you’re new to Python or to programming, you may still be wrestling with Python and not feel like you are in full control yet. In this chapter we’ll address the following questions: \n1. How can you write well-structured, readable programs that you and others will be able to reuse easily?   \n2. How do the fundamental building blocks work, such as loops, functions, and assignment?   \n3. What are some of the pitfalls with Python programming, and how can you avoid them? \nAlong the way, you will consolidate your knowledge of fundamental programming constructs, learn more about using features of the Python language in a natural and concise way, and learn some useful techniques in visualizing natural language data. As before, this chapter contains many examples and exercises (and as before, some exercises introduce new material). Readers new to programming should work through them carefully and consult other introductions to programming if necessary; experienced programmers can quickly skim this chapter. \nIn the other chapters of this book, we have organized the programming concepts as dictated by the needs of NLP. Here we revert to a more conventional approach, where the material is more closely tied to the structure of the programming language. There’s not room for a complete presentation of the language, so we’ll just focus on the language constructs and idioms that are most important for NLP.",

        "content": "4.1  Back to the Basics \nAssignment \nAssignment would seem to be the most elementary programming concept, not deserving a separate discussion. However, there are some surprising subtleties here. Consider the following code fragment: \n>>> foo $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Monty'   \n>>> bar $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ foo   \n>>> foo $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Python'   \n>>> bar   \n'Monty' \nThis behaves exactly as expected. When we write bar $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ foo in the code $bullet$ , the value of foo (the string 'Monty') is assigned to bar. That is, bar is a copy of foo, so when we overwrite foo with a new string 'Python' on line $pmb { theta }$ , the value of bar is not affected. \nHowever, assignment statements do not always involve making copies in this way. Assignment always copies the value of an expression, but a value is not always what you might expect it to be. In particular, the “value” of a structured object such as a list is actually just a reference to the object. In the following example, $bullet$ assigns the reference of foo to the new variable bar. Now when we modify something inside foo on line $bullet$ , we can see that the contents of bar have also been changed. \n>>> foo $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Monty', 'Python']   \n>>> bar $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ foo   \n>>> foo[1] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Bodkin'   \n>>> bar   \n['Monty', 'Bodkin'] \nThe line bar $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ foo  does not copy the contents of the variable, only its “object reference.” To understand what is going on here, we need to know how lists are stored in the computer’s memory. In Figure 4-1, we see that a list foo is a reference to an object stored at location 3133 (which is itself a series of pointers to other locations holding strings). When we assign bar $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ foo, it is just the object reference 3133 that gets copied. This behavior extends to other aspects of the language, such as parameter passing (Section 4.4). \nLet’s experiment some more, by creating a variable empty holding the empty list, then using it three times on the next line. \n>>> empty $= [ ]$   \n>>> nested $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [empty, empty, empty]   \n>>> nested   \n[[], [], []]   \n>>> nested[1].append('Python')   \n>>> nested   \n[['Python'], ['Python'], ['Python']] \nObserve that changing one of the items inside our nested list of lists changed them all. This is because each of the three elements is actually just a reference to one and the same list in memory. \nYour Turn: Use multiplication to create a list of lists: nested $= [ [ ] ] ~ ^ { * }$ 3. Now modify one of the elements of the list, and observe that all the elements are changed. Use Python’s id() function to find out the numerical identifier for any object, and verify that id(nested[0]), id(nested[1]), and id(nested[2]) are all the same. \nNow, notice that when we assign a new value to one of the elements of the list, it does not propagate to the others: \n>>> nested $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [[]] * 3   \n>>> nested[1].append('Python')   \n>>> nested[1] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Monty']   \n>>> nested   \n[['Python'], ['Monty'], ['Python']] \nWe began with a list containing three references to a single empty list object. Then we modified that object by appending 'Python' to it, resulting in a list containing three references to a single list object ['Python']. Next, we overwrote one of those references with a reference to a new object ['Monty']. This last step modified one of the three object references inside the nested list. However, the ['Python'] object wasn’t changed, and is still referenced from two places in our nested list of lists. It is crucial to appreciate this difference between modifying an object via an object reference and overwriting an object reference. \n\nImportant: To copy the items from a list foo to a new list bar, you can write bar $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ foo[:]. This copies the object references inside the list.

        "content": ">>> t[0] 'walk' >>> t[1:] ('fem', 3) >>> len(t) 4 \nCaution! \nTuples are constructed using the comma operator. Parentheses are a more general feature of Python syntax, designed for grouping. A tuple containing the single element 'snark' is defined by adding a trailing comma, like this: 'snark',. The empty tuple is a special case, and is defined using empty parentheses (). \nLet’s compare strings, lists, and tuples directly, and do the indexing, slice, and length operation on each type: \n>>> raw $mathbf { Omega } = mathbf { Omega } ^ { cdot } bar { mathbf { I } }$ turned off the spectroroute'   \n$gg gg$ text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['I', 'turned', 'off', 'the', 'spectroroute']   \n>>> pair $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ (6, 'turned')   \n>>> raw[2], text[3], pair[1]   \n('t', 'the', 'turned')   \n>>> raw[-3:], text[-3:], pair[-3:]   \n('ute', ['off', 'the', 'spectroroute'], (6, 'turned'))   \n>>> len(raw), len(text), len(pair)   \n(29, 5, 2) \nNotice in this code sample that we computed multiple values on a single line, separated by commas. These comma-separated expressions are actually just tuples—Python allows us to omit the parentheses around tuples if there is no ambiguity. When we print a tuple, the parentheses are always displayed. By using tuples in this way, we are implicitly aggregating items together. \nYour Turn: Define a set, e.g., using set(text), and see what happens when you convert it to a list or iterate over its members. \nOperating on Sequence Types \nWe can iterate over the items in a sequence s in a variety of useful ways, as shown in Table 4-1. \nThe sequence functions illustrated in Table 4-1 can be combined in various ways; for example, to get unique elements of s sorted in reverse, use reversed(sorted(set(s))). \nWe can convert between these sequence types. For example, tuple(s) converts any kind of sequence into a tuple, and list(s) converts any kind of sequence into a list. We can convert a list of strings to a single string using the join() function, e.g., ':'.join(words). \nSome other objects, such as a FreqDist, can be converted into a sequence (using list()) and support iteration: \n>>> raw $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Red lorry, yellow lorry, red lorry, yellow lorry.'   \n>>> text $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.word_tokenize(raw)   \n>>> fdist $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FreqDist(text)   \n>>> list(fdist)   \n['lorry', ',', 'yellow', , 'Red', 'red']   \n>>> for key in fdist: print fdist[key],   \n4 3 2 1 1 1 \nIn the next example, we use tuples to re-arrange the contents of our list. (We can omit the parentheses because the comma has higher precedence than assignment.) \n>>> words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['I', 'turned', 'off', 'the', 'spectroroute']   \n>>> words[2], words[3], words[4] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ words[3], words[4], words[2]   \n>>> words   \n['I', 'turned', 'the', 'spectroroute', 'off'] \nThis is an idiomatic and readable way to move items inside a list. It is equivalent to the following traditional way of doing such tasks that does not use tuples (notice that this method needs a temporary variable tmp). \n>>> tmp $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ words[2] >>> words[2] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ words[3] >>> words[3] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ words[4] >>> words[4] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ tmp \nAs we have seen, Python has sequence functions such as sorted() and reversed() that rearrange the items of a sequence. There are also functions that modify the structure of a sequence, which can be handy for language processing. Thus, zip() takes the items of two or more sequences and “zips” them together into a single list of pairs. Given a sequence s, enumerate(s) returns pairs consisting of an index and the item at that index. \n>>> words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['I', 'turned', 'off', 'the', 'spectroroute'] $gg >$ tags $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['noun', 'verb', 'prep', 'det', 'noun'] >>> zip(words, tags) \nFor some NLP tasks it is necessary to cut up a sequence into two or more parts. For instance, we might want to “train” a system on $9 0 %$ of the data and test it on the remaining $1 0 %$ . To do this we decide the location where we want to cut the data $bullet$ , then cut the sequence at that location $pmb { theta }$ . \n>>> text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.nps_chat.words()   \n$gg >$ cut $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ int(0.9 * len(text))   \n>>> training_data, test_data $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ text[:cut], text[cut:]   \n$gg >$ text $scriptstyle = =$ training_data $^ +$ test_data   \nTrue   \n>>> len(training_data) / len(test_data)   \n9 \nWe can verify that none of the original data is lost during this process, nor is it duplicated $bullet$ . We can also verify that the ratio of the sizes of the two pieces is what we intended $bullet$ . \nCombining Different Sequence Types \nLet’s combine our knowledge of these three sequence types, together with list comprehensions, to perform the task of sorting the words in a string by their length. \n>>> words $mathbf { Omega } = mathbf { Omega } ^ { cdot } mathbf { I }$ turned off the spectroroute'.split()   \n>>> wordlens $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(len(word), word) for word in words]   \n>>> wordlens.sort() $otimes$   \n>>> ' '.join( $boldsymbol { mathsf { w } }$ for $( underline { { mathbf { Pi } } } ,  w )$ in wordlens)   \n'I off the turned spectroroute' \nEach of the preceding lines of code contains a significant feature. A simple string is actually an object with methods defined on it, such as split() $bullet$ . We use a list comprehension to build a list of tuples $pmb { theta }$ , where each tuple consists of a number (the word length) and the word, e.g., (3, 'the'). We use the sort() method $bullet$ to sort the list in place. Finally, we discard the length information and join the words back into a single string . (The underscore $bullet$ is just a regular Python variable, but we can use underscore by convention to indicate that we will not use its value.) \nWe began by talking about the commonalities in these sequence types, but the previous code illustrates important differences in their roles. First, strings appear at the beginning and the end: this is typical in the context where our program is reading in some text and producing output for us to read. Lists and tuples are used in the middle, but for different purposes. A list is typically a sequence of objects all having the same type, of arbitrary length. We often use lists to hold sequences of words. In contrast, a tuple is typically a collection of objects of different types, of fixed length. We often use a tuple to hold a record, a collection of different fields relating to some entity.

We often use a tuple to hold a record, a collection of different fields relating to some entity. This distinction between the use of lists and tuples takes some getting used to, so here is another example: \nHere, a lexicon is represented as a list because it is a collection of objects of a single type—lexical entries—of no predetermined length. An individual entry is represented as a tuple because it is a collection of objects with different interpretations, such as the orthographic form, the part-of-speech, and the pronunciations (represented in the SAMPA computer-readable phonetic alphabet; see http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/ sampa/). Note that these pronunciations are stored using a list. (Why?) \nA good way to decide when to use tuples versus lists is to ask whether the interpretation of an item depends on its position. For example, a tagged token combines two strings having different interpretations, and we choose to interpret the first item as the token and the second item as the tag. Thus we use tuples like this: ('grail', 'noun'). A tuple of the form ('noun', 'grail') would be non-sensical since it would be a word noun tagged grail. In contrast, the elements of a text are all tokens, and position is not significant. Thus we use lists like this: ['venetian', 'blind']. A list of the form ['blind', 'venetian'] would be equally valid. The linguistic meaning of the words might be different, but the interpretation of list items as tokens is unchanged. \nThe distinction between lists and tuples has been described in terms of usage. However, there is a more fundamental difference: in Python, lists are mutable, whereas tuples are immutable. In other words, lists can be modified, whereas tuples cannot. Here are some of the operations on lists that do in-place modification of the list: \n>>> lexicon.sort()   \n>>> lexicon[1] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ('turned', 'VBD', ['t3:nd', 't3`nd'])   \n>>> del lexicon[0] \nYour Turn: Convert lexicon to a tuple, using lexicon $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ tuple(lexicon), then try each of the operations, to confirm that none of them is permitted on tuples. \nGenerator Expressions \nWe’ve been making heavy use of list comprehensions, for compact and readable processing of texts. Here’s an example where we tokenize and normalize a text: \n>>> text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ '''\"When I use a word,\" Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, . \"it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less.\"''' >>> [w.lower() for w in nltk.word_tokenize(text)] ['\"', 'when', 'i', 'use', 'a', 'word', 'humpty', 'dumpty', 'said', ...]",

This is more than a notational convenience: in many language processing situations, generator expressions will be more efficient. In $bullet$ , storage for the list object must be allocated before the value of max() is computed. If the text is very large, this could be slow. In $bullet$ , the data is streamed to the calling function. Since the calling function simply has to find the maximum value—the word that comes latest in lexicographic sort order—it can process the stream of data without having to store anything more than the maximum value seen so far. \n4.3  Questions of Style \nProgramming is as much an art as a science. The undisputed “bible” of programming, a 2,500 page multivolume work by Donald Knuth, is called The Art of Computer Programming. Many books have been written on Literate Programming, recognizing that humans, not just computers, must read and understand programs. Here we pick up on some issues of programming style that have important ramifications for the readability of your code, including code layout, procedural versus declarative style, and the use of loop variables. \nPython Coding Style \nWhen writing programs you make many subtle choices about names, spacing, comments, and so on. When you look at code written by other people, needless differences in style make it harder to interpret the code. Therefore, the designers of the Python language have published a style guide for Python code, available at http://www.python .org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. The underlying value presented in the style guide is consistency, for the purpose of maximizing the readability of code. We briefly review some of its key recommendations here, and refer readers to the full guide for detailed discussion with examples. \nCode layout should use four spaces per indentation level. You should make sure that when you write Python code in a file, you avoid tabs for indentation, since these can be misinterpreted by different text editors and the indentation can be messed up. Lines should be less than 80 characters long; if necessary, you can break a line inside parentheses, brackets, or braces, because Python is able to detect that the line continues over to the next line, as in the following examples: \n>>> cv_word_pairs $mathbf { Psi } = mathbf { Psi } left[ left( mathbf { C } mathbf { Psi } mathbf { v } , mathbf { Psi } boldsymbol { w } right) right.$ for $w$ in rotokas_words for cv in re.findall('[ptksvr][aeiou]', w)]",

Therefore, the designers of the Python language have published a style guide for Python code, available at http://www.python .org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. The underlying value presented in the style guide is consistency, for the purpose of maximizing the readability of code. We briefly review some of its key recommendations here, and refer readers to the full guide for detailed discussion with examples. \nCode layout should use four spaces per indentation level. You should make sure that when you write Python code in a file, you avoid tabs for indentation, since these can be misinterpreted by different text editors and the indentation can be messed up. Lines should be less than 80 characters long; if necessary, you can break a line inside parentheses, brackets, or braces, because Python is able to detect that the line continues over to the next line, as in the following examples: \n>>> cv_word_pairs $mathbf { Psi } = mathbf { Psi } left[ left( mathbf { C } mathbf { Psi } mathbf { v } , mathbf { Psi } boldsymbol { w } right) right.$ for $w$ in rotokas_words for cv in re.findall('[ptksvr][aeiou]', w)] \n>>> cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist( (genre, word) for genre in brown.categories() for word in brown.words(categories $ L _ {  L } =$ genre))   \n>>> ha_words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['aaahhhh', 'ah', 'ahah', 'ahahah', 'ahh', 'ahhahahaha', 'ahhh', 'ahhhh', 'ahhhhhh', 'ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh', 'ha', 'haaa', 'hah', 'haha', 'hahaaa', 'hahah', 'hahaha'] \nIf you need to break a line outside parentheses, brackets, or braces, you can often add extra parentheses, and you can always add a backslash at the end of the line that is broken: \n>>> if (len(syllables) > 4 and len(syllables[2]) $= = 3$ and syllables[2][2] in [aeiou] and syllables[2][3] $scriptstyle = =$ syllables[1][3]): process(syllables)   \n>>> if len(syllables) > 4 and len(syllables[2]) $= = 3$ and  syllables[2][2] in [aeiou] and syllables[2][3] $scriptstyle = =$ syllables[1][3]: process(syllables) \nTyping spaces instead of tabs soon becomes a chore. Many programming editors have built-in support for Python, and can automatically indent code and highlight any syntax errors (including indentation errors). For a list of Python-aware editors, please see http://wiki.python .org/moin/PythonEditors. \nProcedural Versus Declarative Style \nWe have just seen how the same task can be performed in different ways, with implications for efficiency. Another factor influencing program development is programming style. Consider the following program to compute the average length of words in the Brown Corpus: \n>>> tokens $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.brown.words(categories $ v { r } =  v { r }$ 'news')   \n>>> count $mathbf { varepsilon } = mathbf { varepsilon } _ { 0 }$   \n>>> total $mathbf { varepsilon } = mathbf { varepsilon } _ { 0 }$   \n>>> for token in tokens: count $scriptstyle + =  1$ total $scriptstyle + =$ len(token)   \n>>> print total / count   \n4.2765382469 \nIn this program we use the variable count to keep track of the number of tokens seen, and total to store the combined length of all words. This is a low-level style, not far removed from machine code, the primitive operations performed by the computer’s CPU. The two variables are just like a CPU’s registers, accumulating values at many intermediate stages, values that are meaningless until the end. We say that this program is written in a procedural style, dictating the machine operations step by step. Now consider the following program that computes the same thing:",

This is a low-level style, not far removed from machine code, the primitive operations performed by the computer’s CPU. The two variables are just like a CPU’s registers, accumulating values at many intermediate stages, values that are meaningless until the end. We say that this program is written in a procedural style, dictating the machine operations step by step. Now consider the following program that computes the same thing: \nThe first line uses a generator expression to sum the token lengths, while the second line computes the average as before. Each line of code performs a complete, meaningful task, which can be understood in terms of high-level properties like: “total is the sum of the lengths of the tokens.” Implementation details are left to the Python interpreter. The second program uses a built-in function, and constitutes programming at a more abstract level; the resulting code is more declarative. Let’s look at an extreme example: \n>>> word_list $= [ ]$   \n>>> len_word_list $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(word_list)   \n$> > > mathrm { ~ i ~ } = 0$   \n$gg >$ while i < len(tokens): ${ dot { textbf { j } } } = 0$ while ${ dot { mathrm { ~ j ~ } } } <$ len_word_list and word_list[j] < tokens[i]: $dot { textbf { j } } + = textbf { 1 }$ if $dot { mathrm { ~  j ~ } } = = 0$ or tokens[i] $ ! =$ word_list[j]: word_list.insert(j, tokens[i]) len_word_list $scriptstyle + =  1$ i += 1 \nThe equivalent declarative version uses familiar built-in functions, and its purpose is instantly recognizable: \nAnother case where a loop counter seems to be necessary is for printing a counter with each line of output. Instead, we can use enumerate(), which processes a sequence s and produces a tuple of the form (i, s[i]) for each item in s, starting with (0, s[0]). Here we enumerate the keys of the frequency distribution, and capture the integer-string pair in the variables rank and word. We print rank $+ 1$ so that the counting appears to start from 1, as required when producing a list of ranked items. \n>>> fd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FreqDist(nltk.corpus.brown.words())   \n>>> cumulative $mathit { Theta } =  0 . 0$   \n>>> for rank, word in enumerate(fd): cumulative $tan angle infty = mathrm { # } { sf t d } [ mathsf { w o r d } ] mathrm { ~ # ~ } 1 0 0 mathrm { ~ / ~ } mathsf { f d } . mathsf { N } ( mathsf { Gamma } )$ print \"%3d %6.2f%% %s\" % (rank $+ 1$ , cumulative, word) if cumulative > 25: break 1 $5 . 4 0 %$ the 2 $1 0 . 4 2 %$ , 3 $1 4 . 6 7 %$ . 4 $1 7 . 7 8 %$ of 5 $2 0 . 1 9 %$ and 6 $2 2 . 4 0 %$ to 7 $2 4 . 2 9 %$ a 8 25.97% in \nIt’s sometimes tempting to use loop variables to store a maximum or minimum value seen so far. Let’s use this method to find the longest word in a text. \n>>> text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.gutenberg.words('milton-paradise.txt')   \n>>> longest $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ''   \n>>> for word in text: if len(word) > len(longest): longest $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ word   \n>>> longest   \n'unextinguishable' \nHowever, a more transparent solution uses two list comprehensions, both having forms that should be familiar by now: \n>>> maxlen $mathbf { beta } = mathbf { beta } mathsf { m } mathsf { a }$ x(len(word) for word in text)   \n$gg >$ [word for word in text if len(word) $scriptstyle = =$ maxlen]   \n['unextinguishable', 'transubstantiate', 'inextinguishable', 'incomprehensible'] \nNote that our first solution found the first word having the longest length, while the second solution found all of the longest words (which is usually what we would want). Although there’s a theoretical efficiency difference between the two solutions, the main overhead is reading the data into main memory; once it’s there, a second pass through the data is effectively instantaneous. We also need to balance our concerns about program efficiency with programmer efficiency. A fast but cryptic solution will be harder to understand and maintain. \nSome Legitimate Uses for Counters \nThere are cases where we still want to use loop variables in a list comprehension. For example, we need to use a loop variable to extract successive overlapping n-grams from a list: \nIt is quite tricky to get the range of the loop variable right. Since this is a common operation in NLP, NLTK supports it with functions bigrams(text) and trigrams(text), and a general-purpose ngrams(text, n). \nHere’s an example of how we can use loop variables in building multidimensional structures. For example, to build an array with $m$ rows and $n$ columns, where each cell is a set, we could use a nested list comprehension: \n>>> m, ${ textsf { n } } = 3$ , 7   \n$gg >$ array $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [[set() for i in range(n)] for j in range(m)]   \n>>> array[2][5].add('Alice')   \n>>> pprint.pprint(array)   \n[[set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([])], [set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([])], [set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set(['Alice']), set([])]]",

As another example of this usage, observe that the expression ['very' for i in range(3)] produces a list containing three instances of 'very', with no integers in sight. \nNote that it would be incorrect to do this work using multiplication, for reasons concerning object copying that were discussed earlier in this section. \n>>> array $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [[set()] * n] * m   \n>>> array[2][5].add(7)   \n>>> pprint.pprint(array)   \n[[set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7])], [set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7])], [set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7]), set([7])]] \nIteration is an important programming device. It is tempting to adopt idioms from other languages. However, Python offers some elegant and highly readable alternatives, as we have seen. \n4.4  Functions: The Foundation of Structured Programming \nFunctions provide an effective way to package and reuse program code, as already explained in Section 2.3. For example, suppose we find that we often want to read text from an HTML file. This involves several steps: opening the file, reading it in, normalizing whitespace, and stripping HTML markup. We can collect these steps into a function, and give it a name such as get_text(), as shown in Example 4-1. \nExample 4-1. Read text from a file. \nimport re   \ndef get_text(file): \"\"\"Read text from a file, normalizing whitespace and stripping HTML markup.\"\"\" text $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ open(file).read() text $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ re.sub( $\" backslash { mathsf { s } } + \"$ , , text) text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ re.sub $ cdot ^ { prime } < . ^ { * } ? >$ ', , text) return text \nNow, any time we want to get cleaned-up text from an HTML file, we can just call get_text() with the name of the file as its only argument. It will return a string, and we can assign this to a variable, e.g., contents $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ get_text(\"test.html\"). Each time we want to use this series of steps, we only have to call the function. \nUsing functions has the benefit of saving space in our program. More importantly, our choice of name for the function helps make the program readable. In the case of the preceding example, whenever our program needs to read cleaned-up text from a file we don’t have to clutter the program with four lines of code; we simply need to call get_text(). This naming helps to provide some “semantic interpretation”—it helps a reader of our program to see what the program “means.”",

        "content": "Notice that this example function definition contains a string. The first string inside a function definition is called a docstring. Not only does it document the purpose of the function to someone reading the code, it is accessible to a programmer who has loaded the code from a file: \n>>> help(get_text)   \nHelp on function get_text:   \nget_text(file) Read text from a file, normalizing whitespace and stripping HTML markup. \nWe have seen that functions help to make our work reusable and readable. They also help make it reliable. When we reuse code that has already been developed and tested, we can be more confident that it handles a variety of cases correctly. We also remove the risk of forgetting some important step or introducing a bug. The program that calls our function also has increased reliability. The author of that program is dealing with a shorter program, and its components behave transparently. \nTo summarize, as its name suggests, a function captures functionality. It is a segment of code that can be given a meaningful name and which performs a well-defined task. Functions allow us to abstract away from the details, to see a bigger picture, and to program more effectively. \nThe rest of this section takes a closer look at functions, exploring the mechanics and discussing ways to make your programs easier to read. \nFunction Inputs and Outputs \nWe pass information to functions using a function’s parameters, the parenthesized list of variables and constants following the function’s name in the function definition. Here’s a complete example: \n>>> def repeat(msg, num): return ' '.join([msg] * num) >>> monty $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Monty Python' >>> repeat(monty, 3) 'Monty Python Monty Python Monty Python' \nWe first define the function to take two parameters, msg and num $bullet$ . Then, we call the function and pass it two arguments, monty and $3 textcircled { circ }$ ; these arguments fill the “placeholders” provided by the parameters and provide values for the occurrences of msg and num in the function body. \nIt is not necessary to have any parameters, as we see in the following example: \n>>> def monty(): return \"Monty Python\"   \n>>> monty()   \n'Monty Python' \nA function usually communicates its results back to the calling program via the return statement, as we have just seen. To the calling program, it looks as if the function call had been replaced with the function’s result: \n>>> repeat(monty(), 3) 'Monty Python Monty Python Monty Python' >>> repeat('Monty Python', 3) 'Monty Python Monty Python Monty Python' \nA Python function is not required to have a return statement. Some functions do their work as a side effect, printing a result, modifying a file, or updating the contents of a parameter to the function (such functions are called “procedures” in some other programming languages). \nConsider the following three sort functions. The third one is dangerous because a programmer could use it without realizing that it had modified its input. In general, functions should modify the contents of a parameter (my_sort1()), or return a value (my_sort2()), but not both (my_sort3()). \n>>> def my_sort1(mylist): # good: modifies its argument, no return value mylist.sort()   \n>>> def my_sort2(mylist): # good: doesn't touch its argument, returns value return sorted(mylist)   \n>>> def my_sort3(mylist): # bad: modifies its argument and also returns it mylist.sort() return mylist \nParameter Passing \nBack in Section 4.1, you saw that assignment works on values, but that the value of a structured object is a reference to that object. The same is true for functions. Python interprets function parameters as values (this is known as call-by-value). In the following code, set_up() has two parameters, both of which are modified inside the function. We begin by assigning an empty string to $w$ and an empty dictionary to p. After calling the function, $boldsymbol { mathsf { w } }$ is unchanged, while $mathfrak { p }$ is changed: \n>>> def set_up(word, properties): word $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'lolcat' properties.append('noun') properties $= 5$   \n$begin{array} { r l } & { ~ > > ~ mathsf { w } = ~ ^ { textsf { tiny { t } } } }  & { ~ > ~ mathsf { p } ~ = ~ [ ~ ] }  & { ~ > ~ mathsf { s e t _ w e } [ ~ mathsf { w } , ~ mathsf { p } ) }  & { ~ > ~ mathsf { w } }  & { ~ mapsto ~ mathsf { w } }  & { ~ > ~ mathsf { p } ~ }  & { ~ [ ~ : ~ mathsf { n o u n } ^ { textsf { tiny { t } } } ] } end{array}$ \nNotice that $w$ was not changed by the function. When we called set $mathsf { Pi } _ { mathsf { m } } mathsf { p } ( mathsf { w } , mathsf { p } )$ , the value of $boldsymbol { mathsf { w } }$ (an empty string) was assigned to a new variable word. Inside the function, the value of word was modified. However, that change did not propagate to $w$ . This parameter passing is identical to the following sequence of assignments:",

For example, a tagger might expect a sequence of words, but it wouldn’t care whether this sequence is expressed as a list, a tuple, or an iterator (a new sequence type that we’ll discuss later). \nHowever, often we want to write programs for later use by others, and want to program in a defensive style, providing useful warnings when functions have not been invoked correctly. The author of the following tag() function assumed that its argument would always be a string. \n>>> def tag(word): if word in ['a', 'the', 'all']: return 'det' else: return 'noun'   \n>>> tag('the')   \n'det'   \n>>> tag('knight')   \n'noun'   \n>>> tag([\"'Tis\", 'but', 'a', 'scratch'])   \n'noun' \nThe function returns sensible values for the arguments 'the' and 'knight', but look what happens when it is passed a list $bullet$ —it fails to complain, even though the result which it returns is clearly incorrect. The author of this function could take some extra steps to ensure that the word parameter of the tag() function is a string. A naive approach would be to check the type of the argument using if not type(word) is str, and if word is not a string, to simply return Python’s special empty value, None. This is a slight improvement, because the function is checking the type of the argument, and trying to return a “special” diagnostic value for the wrong input. However, it is also dangerous because the calling program may not detect that None is intended as a “special” value, and this diagnostic return value may then be propagated to other parts of the program with unpredictable consequences. This approach also fails if the word is a Unicode string, which has type unicode, not str. Here’s a better solution, using an assert statement together with Python’s basestring type that generalizes over both unicode and str. \n>>> def tag(word): assert isinstance(word, basestring), \"argument to tag() must be a string\" if word in ['a', 'the', 'all']: return 'det' else: return 'noun' \nIf the assert statement fails, it will produce an error that cannot be ignored, since it halts program execution. Additionally, the error message is easy to interpret. Adding assertions to a program helps you find logical errors, and is a kind of defensive programming. A more fundamental approach is to document the parameters to each function using docstrings, as described later in this section.",

When a block of program code grows longer than 10–20 lines, it is a great help to readability if the code is broken up into one or more functions, each one having a clear purpose. This is analogous to the way a good essay is divided into paragraphs, each expressing one main idea. \nFunctions provide an important kind of abstraction. They allow us to group multiple actions into a single, complex action, and associate a name with it. (Compare this with the way we combine the actions of go and bring back into a single more complex action fetch.) When we use functions, the main program can be written at a higher level of abstraction, making its structure transparent, as in the following: \n>>> data $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ load_corpus() >>> results $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ analyze(data) >>> present(results) \nAppropriate use of functions makes programs more readable and maintainable. Additionally, it becomes possible to reimplement a function—replacing the function’s body with more efficient code—without having to be concerned with the rest of the program. \nConsider the freq_words function in Example 4-2. It updates the contents of a frequency distribution that is passed in as a parameter, and it also prints a list of the $n$ most frequent words. \nExample 4-2. Poorly designed function to compute frequent words. \ndef freq_words(url, freqdist, n): text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.clean_url(url) for word in nltk.word_tokenize(text): freqdist.inc(word.lower()) print freqdist.keys()[:n]   \n>>> constitution $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience\"  \"/charters/constitution_transcript.html\"   \n>>> fd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FreqDist()   \n>>> freq_words(constitution, fd, 20)   \n['the', 'of', 'charters', 'bill', 'constitution', 'rights',   \n'declaration', 'impact', 'freedom', 'making', 'independence'] \nThis function has a number of problems.

The first time this function is called, it gets as far as the yield statement and pauses. The calling program gets the first word and does any necessary processing. Once the calling program is ready for another word, execution of the function is continued from where it stopped, until the next time it encounters a yield statement. This approach is typically more efficient, as the function only generates the data as it is required by the calling program, and does not need to allocate additional memory to store the output (see the earlier discussion of generator expressions). \nHere’s a more sophisticated example of a generator which produces all permutations of a list of words. In order to force the permutations() function to generate all its output, we wrap it with a call to $mathtt { l i s t ( ) } bullet$ . \n>>> def permutations(seq): if len(seq) $scriptstyle < = ~ 1$ : yield seq else: for perm in permutations(seq[1:]): for i in range(len(perm) $+ 1$ ): yield perm[:i] $mathbf { xi } + mathsf {  s e q }$ [0:1] $^ +$ perm[i:]   \n>>> list(permutations(['police', 'fish', 'buffalo']))   \n[['police', 'fish', 'buffalo'], ['fish', 'police', 'buffalo'],   \n['fish', 'buffalo', 'police'], ['police', 'buffalo', 'fish'],   \n['buffalo', 'police', 'fish'], ['buffalo', 'fish', 'police']] \nThe permutations function uses a technique called recursion, discussed later in Section 4.7. The ability to generate permutations of a set of words is useful for creating data to test a grammar (Chapter 8). \nHigher-Order Functions \nPython provides some higher-order functions that are standard features of functional programming languages such as Haskell. We illustrate them here, alongside the equivalent expression using list comprehensions. \nLet’s start by defining a function is_content_word() which checks whether a word is from the open class of content words. We use this function as the first parameter of filter(), which applies the function to each item in the sequence contained in its second parameter, and retains only the items for which the function returns True.",

In order to force the permutations() function to generate all its output, we wrap it with a call to $mathtt { l i s t ( ) } bullet$ . \n>>> def permutations(seq): if len(seq) $scriptstyle < = ~ 1$ : yield seq else: for perm in permutations(seq[1:]): for i in range(len(perm) $+ 1$ ): yield perm[:i] $mathbf { xi } + mathsf {  s e q }$ [0:1] $^ +$ perm[i:]   \n>>> list(permutations(['police', 'fish', 'buffalo']))   \n[['police', 'fish', 'buffalo'], ['fish', 'police', 'buffalo'],   \n['fish', 'buffalo', 'police'], ['police', 'buffalo', 'fish'],   \n['buffalo', 'police', 'fish'], ['buffalo', 'fish', 'police']] \nThe permutations function uses a technique called recursion, discussed later in Section 4.7. The ability to generate permutations of a set of words is useful for creating data to test a grammar (Chapter 8). \nHigher-Order Functions \nPython provides some higher-order functions that are standard features of functional programming languages such as Haskell. We illustrate them here, alongside the equivalent expression using list comprehensions. \nLet’s start by defining a function is_content_word() which checks whether a word is from the open class of content words. We use this function as the first parameter of filter(), which applies the function to each item in the sequence contained in its second parameter, and retains only the items for which the function returns True. \n>>> def is_content_word(word): return word.lower() not in ['a', 'of', 'the', 'and', 'will', ',', ']   \n>>> sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['Take', 'care', 'of', 'the', 'sense', 'and', 'the', 'sounds', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'of', 'themselves', '.']   \n>>> filter(is_content_word, sent)   \n['Take', 'care', 'sense', 'sounds', 'take', 'care', 'themselves']   \n>>> [w for w in sent if is_content_word(w)]   \n['Take', 'care', 'sense', 'sounds', 'take', 'care', 'themselves'] \nAnother higher-order function is map(), which applies a function to every item in a sequence. It is a general version of the extract_property() function we saw earlier in this section. Here is a simple way to find the average length of a sentence in the news section of the Brown Corpus, followed by an equivalent version with list comprehension calculation: \n>>> lengths $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ map(len, nltk.corpus.brown.sents(categories $ v { r } =  v { r }$ 'news'))   \n>>> sum(lengths) / len(lengths)   \n21.7508111616   \n>>> lengths $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [len(w) for w in nltk.corpus.brown.sents(categories $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'news'))]   \n>>> sum(lengths) / len(lengths)   \n21.7508111616 \nIn the previous examples, we specified a user-defined function is_content_word() and a built-in function len(). We can also provide a lambda expression. Here’s a pair of equivalent examples that count the number of vowels in each word. \n>>> map(lambda w: len(filter(lambda c: c.lower() in \"aeiou\", w)), sent)   \n[2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0]   \n>>> [len([c for c in w if c.lower() in \"aeiou\"]) for w in sent]   \n[2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0] \nThe solutions based on list comprehensions are usually more readable than the solutions based on higher-order functions, and we have favored the former approach throughout this book. \nNamed Arguments \nWhen there are a lot of parameters it is easy to get confused about the correct order. Instead we can refer to parameters by name, and even assign them a default value just in case one was not provided by the calling program. Now the parameters can be specified in any order, and can be omitted. \n>>> def repeat( $scriptstyle { mathsf { m } } displaystyle mathsf { s g } = { mathsf { prime } }$ <empty>', num $scriptstyle = 1$ ): return msg * num   \n>>> repeat(num $^ { = 3 }$ )   \n'<empty><empty><empty>'   \n>>> repeat(msg='Alice')   \n'Alice'   \n>>> repeat(num $1 = 5$ , msg $mathbf { bar { rho } } = mathbf { bar { rho } }$ Alice')   \n'AliceAliceAliceAliceAlice' \nThese are called keyword arguments. If we mix these two kinds of parameters, then we must ensure that the unnamed parameters precede the named ones. It has to be this way, since unnamed parameters are defined by position. We can define a function that takes an arbitrary number of unnamed and named parameters, and access them via an in-place list of arguments *args and an in-place dictionary of keyword arguments **kwargs.",

We can define a function that takes an arbitrary number of unnamed and named parameters, and access them via an in-place list of arguments *args and an in-place dictionary of keyword arguments **kwargs. \n\n>>> def generic(*args, **kwargs): print args print kwargs   \n>>> generic(1, \"African swallow\", monty $mathbf { bar { rho } } = mathbf { rho }$ \"python\")   \n(1, 'African swallow')   \n{'monty': 'python'} \nWhen *args appears as a function parameter, it actually corresponds to all the unnamed parameters of the function. As another illustration of this aspect of Python syntax, consider the zip() function, which operates on a variable number of arguments. We’ll use the variable name *song to demonstrate that there’s nothing special about the name *args. \n>>> song $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [['four', 'calling', 'birds'], ['three', 'French', 'hens'], ['two', 'turtle', 'doves']]   \n>>> zip(song[0], song[1], song[2])   \n[('four', 'three', 'two'), ('calling', 'French', 'turtle'), ('birds', 'hens', 'doves')]   \n>>> zip(*song)   \n[('four', 'three', 'two'), ('calling', 'French', 'turtle'), ('birds', 'hens', 'doves')] \nIt should be clear from this example that typing *song is just a convenient shorthand, and equivalent to typing out song[0], song[1], song[2]. \nHere’s another example of the use of keyword arguments in a function definition, along with three equivalent ways to call the function: \n>>> def freq_words(file, min $_ { | = 1 }$ , num $scriptstyle 1 = 1 0$ ):text $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ open(file).read()tokens $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.word_tokenize(text)freqdist $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FreqDist(t for t in tokens if len(t) >= min)return freqdist.keys()[:num]  \n>>> fw $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ freq_words('ch01.rst', 4, 10)  \n>>> fw $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ freq_words('ch01.rst', min $scriptstyle 1 = 4$ , num $_ { 1 = 1 0 }$ )  \n>>> fw $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ freq_words('ch01.rst', num $scriptstyle 1 = 1 0$ , min $^ { = 4 }$ )\nA side effect of having named arguments is that they permit optionality. Thus we can leave out any arguments where we are happy with the default value: freq_words('ch01.rst', min $scriptstyle = 4$ ), freq_words('ch01.rst', 4). Another common use of optional arguments is to permit a flag. Here’s a revised version of the same function that reports its progress if a verbose flag is set: \n>>> def freq_words(file, min $^ { = 1 }$ , num $scriptstyle 1 = 1 0$ , verbose $ c =$ False): freqdist $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ FreqDist() if trace: print \"Opening\", file text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ open(file).read() if trace: print \"Read in %d characters\" % len(file) for word in nltk.word_tokenize(text): \n+ \nif len(word) $> =$ min: freqdist.inc(word) if trace and freqdist.N() % $1 0 0 ~ = = ~ 0$ : print \". if trace: print return freqdist.keys()[:num] \nCaution! \nTake care not to use a mutable object as the default value of a parameter. A series of calls to the function will use the same object, sometimes with bizarre results, as we will see in the discussion of debugging later. \n4.6  Program Development \nProgramming is a skill that is acquired over several years of experience with a variety of programming languages and tasks. Key high-level abilities are algorithm design and its manifestation in structured programming. Key low-level abilities include familiarity with the syntactic constructs of the language, and knowledge of a variety of diagnostic methods for trouble-shooting a program which does not exhibit the expected behavior. \nThis section describes the internal structure of a program module and how to organize a multi-module program. Then it describes various kinds of error that arise during program development, what you can do to fix them and, better still, to avoid them in the first place. \nStructure of a Python Module \nThe purpose of a program module is to bring logically related definitions and functions together in order to facilitate reuse and abstraction. Python modules are nothing more than individual .py files. For example, if you were working with a particular corpus format, the functions to read and write the format could be kept together. Constants used by both formats, such as field separators, or a EXTN $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \".inf\" filename extension, could be shared. If the format was updated, you would know that only one file needed to be changed. Similarly, a module could contain code for creating and manipulating a particular data structure such as syntax trees, or code for performing a particular processing task such as plotting corpus statistics. \nWhen you start writing Python modules, it helps to have some examples to emulate. You can locate the code for any NLTK module on your system using the __file__ variable: \n>>> nltk.metrics.distance.__file '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/nltk/metrics/distance.pyc' \nThis returns the location of the compiled .pyc file for the module, and you’ll probably see a different location on your machine. The file that you will need to open is the corresponding .py source file, and this will be in the same directory as the .pyc file.",

Something as trivial as a misplaced symbol might cause the program to behave very differently. We call these “bugs” because they are tiny in comparison to the damage they can cause. They creep into our code unnoticed, and it’s only much later when we’re running the program on some new data that their presence is detected. Sometimes, fixing one bug only reveals another, and we get the distinct impression that the bug is on the move. The only reassurance we have is that bugs are spontaneous and not the fault of the programmer. \nFlippancy aside, debugging code is hard because there are so many ways for it to be faulty. Our understanding of the input data, the algorithm, or even the programming language, may be at fault. Let’s look at examples of each of these. \nFirst, the input data may contain some unexpected characters. For example, WordNet synset names have the form tree.n.01, with three components separated using periods. The NLTK WordNet module initially decomposed these names using split('.'). However, this method broke when someone tried to look up the word $P h D$ , which has the synset name ph.d..n.01, containing four periods instead of the expected two. The solution was to use rsplit('.', 2) to do at most two splits, using the rightmost instances of the period, and leaving the ph.d. string intact. Although several people had tested the module before it was released, it was some weeks before someone detected the problem (see http://code.google.com/p/nltk/issues/detail?id=297). \nSecond, a supplied function might not behave as expected. For example, while testing NLTK’s interface to WordNet, one of the authors noticed that no synsets had any antonyms defined, even though the underlying database provided a large quantity of antonym information. What looked like a bug in the WordNet interface turned out to be a misunderstanding about WordNet itself: antonyms are defined for lemmas, not for synsets. The only “bug” was a misunderstanding of the interface (see http://code .google.com/p/nltk/issues/detail?id=98). \nThird, our understanding of Python’s semantics may be at fault. It is easy to make the wrong assumption about the relative scope of two operators. For example, \"%s.%s. %02d\" % \"ph.d.\", \"n\", 1 produces a runtime error TypeError: not enough arguments for format string. This is because the percent operator has higher precedence than the comma operator. The fix is to add parentheses in order to force the required scope. As another example, suppose we are defining a function to collect all tokens of a text having a given length. The function has parameters for the text and the word length, and an extra parameter that allows the initial value of the result to be given as a parameter: \n>>> def find_words(text, wordlength, result $scriptstyle = [ ]$ ): for word in text: if len(word) $scriptstyle = =$ wordlength: result.append(word) return result   \n>>> find_words(['omg', 'teh', 'lolcat', 'sitted', 'on', 'teh', 'mat'], 3)   \n['omg', 'teh', 'teh', 'mat']   \n>>> find_words(['omg', 'teh', 'lolcat', 'sitted', 'on', 'teh', 'mat'], 2, ['ur'])   \n['ur', 'on']   \n>>> find_words(['omg', 'teh', 'lolcat', 'sitted', 'on', 'teh', 'mat'], 3)   \n['omg', 'teh', 'teh', 'mat', 'omg', 'teh', 'teh', 'mat'] \nThe first time we call find_words() $bullet$ , we get all three-letter words as expected. The second time we specify an initial value for the result, a one-element list $[ : mathsf { u r } ^ { prime } ]$ , and as expected, the result has this word along with the other two-letter word in our text. Now, the next time we call find_words() $bullet$ we use the same parameters as in $bullet$ , but we get a different result! Each time we call find_words() with no third parameter, the result will simply extend the result of the previous call, rather than start with the empty result list as specified in the function definition. The program’s behavior is not as expected because we incorrectly assumed that the default value was created at the time the function was invoked. However, it is created just once, at the time the Python interpreter loads the function. This one list object is used whenever no explicit value is provided to the function. \n\nDebugging Techniques \nSince most code errors result from the programmer making incorrect assumptions, the first thing to do when you detect a bug is to check your assumptions. Localize the problem by adding print statements to the program, showing the value of important variables, and showing how far the program has progressed. \nIf the program produced an “exception”—a runtime error—the interpreter will print a stack trace, pinpointing the location of program execution at the time of the error. If the program depends on input data, try to reduce this to the smallest size while still producing the error. \nOnce you have localized the problem to a particular function or to a line of code, you need to work out what is going wrong. It is often helpful to recreate the situation using the interactive command line. Define some variables, and then copy-paste the offending line of code into the session and see what happens. Check your understanding of the code by reading some documentation and examining other code samples that purport to do the same thing that you are trying to do. Try explaining your code to someone else, in case she can see where things are going wrong. \nPython provides a debugger which allows you to monitor the execution of your program, specify line numbers where execution will stop (i.e., breakpoints), and step through sections of code and inspect the value of variables. You can invoke the debugger on your code as follows: \n>>> import pdb   \n>>> import mymodule   \n>>> pdb.run('mymodule.myfunction()') \nIt will present you with a prompt (Pdb) where you can type instructions to the debugger. Type help to see the full list of commands. Typing step (or just s) will execute the current line and stop. If the current line calls a function, it will enter the function and stop at the first line. Typing next (or just n) is similar, but it stops execution at the next line in the current function. The break (or b) command can be used to create or list breakpoints. Type continue (or c) to continue execution as far as the next breakpoint. Type the name of any variable to inspect its value. \nWe can use the Python debugger to locate the problem in our find_words() function. Remember that the problem arose the second time the function was called. We’ll start by calling the function without using the debugger $bullet$ , using the smallest possible input. The second time, we’ll call it with the debugger .",

Check your understanding of the code by reading some documentation and examining other code samples that purport to do the same thing that you are trying to do. Try explaining your code to someone else, in case she can see where things are going wrong. \nPython provides a debugger which allows you to monitor the execution of your program, specify line numbers where execution will stop (i.e., breakpoints), and step through sections of code and inspect the value of variables. You can invoke the debugger on your code as follows: \n>>> import pdb   \n>>> import mymodule   \n>>> pdb.run('mymodule.myfunction()') \nIt will present you with a prompt (Pdb) where you can type instructions to the debugger. Type help to see the full list of commands. Typing step (or just s) will execute the current line and stop. If the current line calls a function, it will enter the function and stop at the first line. Typing next (or just n) is similar, but it stops execution at the next line in the current function. The break (or b) command can be used to create or list breakpoints. Type continue (or c) to continue execution as far as the next breakpoint. Type the name of any variable to inspect its value. \nWe can use the Python debugger to locate the problem in our find_words() function. Remember that the problem arose the second time the function was called. We’ll start by calling the function without using the debugger $bullet$ , using the smallest possible input. The second time, we’ll call it with the debugger . \n>>> import pdb   \n>>> find_words(['cat'], 3)   \n['cat']   \n>>> pdb.run(\"find_words(['dog'], 3)\")   \n> <string>(1)<module>()   \n(Pdb) step   \n--Call--   \n> <stdin>(1)find_words()   \n(Pdb) args   \ntext = ['dog']   \nwordlength $= 3$   \nresult $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['cat'] \nHere we typed just two commands into the debugger: step took us inside the function, and args showed the values of its arguments (or parameters). We see immediately that result has an initial value of $[ ` cot ^ { prime } ]$ , and not the empty list as expected. The debugger has helped us to localize the problem, prompting us to check our understanding of Python functions. \nDefensive Programming \nIn order to avoid some of the pain of debugging, it helps to adopt some defensive programming habits. Instead of writing a 20-line program and then testing it, build the program bottom-up out of small pieces that are known to work. Each time you combine these pieces to make a larger unit, test it carefully to see that it works as expected. Consider adding assert statements to your code, specifying properties of a variable, e.g., assert(isinstance(text, list)). If the value of the text variable later becomes a string when your code is used in some larger context, this will raise an AssertionError and you will get immediate notification of the problem. \nOnce you think you’ve found the bug, view your solution as a hypothesis. Try to predict the effect of your bugfix before re-running the program. If the bug isn’t fixed, don’t fall into the trap of blindly changing the code in the hope that it will magically start working again. Instead, for each change, try to articulate a hypothesis about what is wrong and why the change will fix the problem. Then undo the change if the problem was not resolved. \nAs you develop your program, extend its functionality, and fix any bugs, it helps to maintain a suite of test cases. This is called regression testing, since it is meant to detect situations where the code “regresses”—where a change to the code has an unintended side effect of breaking something that used to work. Python provides a simple regression-testing framework in the form of the doctest module. This module searches a file of code or documentation for blocks of text that look like an interactive Python session, of the form you have already seen many times in this book. It executes the Python commands it finds, and tests that their output matches the output supplied in the original file. Whenever there is a mismatch, it reports the expected and actual values.

For example, in order to detect duplicate entries in a list, we can pre-sort the list, then scan through it once to check whether any adjacent pairs of elements are identical. \nRecursion \nThe earlier examples of sorting and searching have a striking property: to solve a problem of size $n$ , we have to break it in half and then work on one or more problems of size $n / 2$ . A common way to implement such methods uses recursion. We define a function $f ,$ which simplifies the problem, and calls itself to solve one or more easier instances of the same problem. It then combines the results into a solution for the original problem. \n\nFor example, suppose we have a set of $n$ words, and want to calculate how many different ways they can be combined to make a sequence of words. If we have only one word $( n { = } 1 )$ , there is just one way to make it into a sequence. If we have a set of two words, there are two ways to put them into a sequence. For three words there are six possibilities. In general, for $n$ words, there are $n times n  – 1 times ldots times 2 times 1$ ways (i.e., the factorial of $n$ ). We can code this up as follows: \n>>> def factorial1(n): result $mathbf { Psi } = mathbf { Psi } _ { 1 }$ for i in range(n): result $ast = mathrm { ( i } ast { 1 } )$ return result \nHowever, there is also a recursive algorithm for solving this problem, based on the following observation. Suppose we have a way to construct all orderings for n-1 distinct words. Then for each such ordering, there are $n$ places where we can insert a new word: at the start, the end, or any of the $n { - } 2$ boundaries between the words. Thus we simply multiply the number of solutions found for $n { - } 1$ by the value of n. We also need the base case, to say that if we have a single word, there’s just one ordering. We can code this up as follows: \n>>> def factorial2(n): if $textsf { n } = = textsf { 1 }$ : return 1 else: return n * factorial2(n-1) \nThese two algorithms solve the same problem. One uses iteration while the other uses recursion. We can use recursion to navigate a deeply nested object, such as the WordNet hypernym hierarchy. Let’s count the size of the hypernym hierarchy rooted at a given synset s. We’ll do this by finding the size of each hyponym of $s$ , then adding these together (we will also add 1 for the synset itself). The following function size1() does this work; notice that the body of the function includes a recursive call to size1(): \n>>> def size1(s): return $^ { 1 + }$ sum(size1(child) for child in s.hyponyms()) \nWe can also design an iterative solution to this problem which processes the hierarchy in layers. The first layer is the synset itself $bullet$ , then all the hyponyms of the synset, then all the hyponyms of the hyponyms. Each time through the loop it computes the next layer by finding the hyponyms of everything in the last layer $bullet$ . It also maintains a total of the number of synsets encountered so far $pmb { theta }$ . \n>>> def size2(s): layer = [s] total $mathbf { varepsilon } = mathbf { varepsilon } _ { 0 }$ while layer: total $^ { + = }$ len(layer) layer $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [h for c in layer for h in c.hyponyms()] return total \nNot only is the iterative solution much longer, it is harder to interpret. It forces us to think procedurally, and keep track of what is happening with the layer and total variables through time. Let’s satisfy ourselves that both solutions give the same result. We’ll use a new form of the import statement, allowing us to abbreviate the name wordnet to wn: \n>>> from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn   \n>>> dog $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ wn.synset('dog.n.01')   \n>>> size1(dog)   \n190   \n>>> size2(dog)   \n190 \nAs a final example of recursion, let’s use it to construct a deeply nested object. A letter trie is a data structure that can be used for indexing a lexicon, one letter at a time. (The name is based on the word retrieval.) For example, if trie contained a letter trie, then trie['c'] would be a smaller trie which held all words starting with $c$ . Example 4-6 demonstrates the recursive process of building a trie, using Python dictionaries (Section 5.3). To insert the word chien (French for dog), we split off the $c$ and recursively insert hien into the sub-trie trie['c']. The recursion continues until there are no letters remaining in the word, when we store the intended value (in this case, the word dog). \nExample 4-6. Building a letter trie: A recursive function that builds a nested dictionary structure; each level of nesting contains all words with a given prefix, and a sub-trie containing all possible continuations. \ndef insert(trie, key, value): if key: first, rest $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ key[0], key[1:] if first not in trie: trie[first] = {} insert(trie[first], rest, value) else: trie['value'] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ value   \n>>> trie $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.defaultdict(dict)   \n>>> insert(trie, 'chat', 'cat')   \n>>> insert(trie, 'chien', 'dog')   \n>>> insert(trie, 'chair', 'flesh')   \n>>> insert(trie, 'chic', 'stylish')   \n>>> trie $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ dict(trie) # for nicer printing   \n>>> trie['c']['h']['a']['t']['value']   \n'cat'   \n>>> pprint.pprint(trie)   \n{'c': {'h': {'a': {'t': {'value': 'cat'}}, {'i': {'r': {'value': 'flesh'}}}, 'i': {'e': {'n': {'value': 'dog'}}} {'c': {'value': 'stylish'}}}}} \nCaution! \nDespite the simplicity of recursive programming, it comes with a cost. Each time a function is called, some state information needs to be pushed on a stack, so that once the function has completed, execution can continue from where it left off. For this reason, iterative solutions are often more efficient than recursive solutions. \nSpace-Time Trade-offs \nWe can sometimes significantly speed up the execution of a program by building an auxiliary data structure, such as an index. The listing in Example 4-7 implements a simple text retrieval system for the Movie Reviews Corpus. By indexing the document collection, it provides much faster lookup. \nExample 4-7.

We create a vocabulary for the corpus, a list in which each word is stored once, then invert this list so that we can look up any word to find its identifier. Each document is preprocessed, so that a list of words becomes a list of integers. Any language models can now work with integers. See the listing in Example 4-8 for an example of how to do this for a tagged corpus. \nExample 4-8. Preprocess tagged corpus data, converting all words and tags to integers. \ndef preprocess(tagged_corpus): words $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ set() tags $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ set() for sent in tagged_corpus: for word, tag in sent: words.add(word) tags.add(tag) $mathsf { w m }  =  mathsf { d i c t } ( ( boldsymbol { mathsf { w } } , mathrm { i } )$ for $( dot { 1 } , w )$ in enumerate(words)) tm $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ dict((t,i) for (i,t) in enumerate(tags)) return [[(wm[w], tm[t]) for $( w , mathrm { t } )$ in sent] for sent in tagged_corpus] \nAnother example of a space-time trade-off is maintaining a vocabulary list. If you need to process an input text to check that all words are in an existing vocabulary, the vocabulary should be stored as a set, not a list. The elements of a set are automatically indexed, so testing membership of a large set will be much faster than testing membership of the corresponding list. \nWe can test this claim using the timeit module. The Timer class has two parameters: a statement that is executed multiple times, and setup code that is executed once at the beginning. We will simulate a vocabulary of 100,000 items using a list $bullet$ or set $pmb { theta }$ of integers. The test statement will generate a random item that has a $5 0 %$ chance of being in the vocabulary $bullet$ . \n>>> from timeit import Timer   \n>>> vocab_size $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ 100000   \n>>> setup_list $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ \"import random; vocab $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ range(%d)\" % vocab_size   \n>>> setup_set $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ \"import random; vocab $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ set(range(%d))\" % vocab_size 2   \n>>> statement $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ \"random.randint(0, %d) in vocab\" $%$ vocab_size $* _ { 2 } bullet$   \n>>> print Timer(statement, setup_list).timeit(1000)   \n2.78092288971   \n>>> print Timer(statement, setup_set).timeit(1000)   \n0.0037260055542 \nPerforming 1,000 list membership tests takes a total of 2.8 seconds, whereas the equivalent tests on a set take a mere 0.0037 seconds, or three orders of magnitude faster! \nDynamic Programming \nDynamic programming is a general technique for designing algorithms which is widely used in natural language processing. The term “programming” is used in a different sense to what you might expect, to mean planning or scheduling. Dynamic programming is used when a problem contains overlapping subproblems. Instead of computing solutions to these subproblems repeatedly, we simply store them in a lookup table. In the remainder of this section, we will introduce dynamic programming, but in a rather different context to syntactic parsing. \nPingala was an Indian author who lived around the 5th century B.C., and wrote a treatise on Sanskrit prosody called the Chandas Shastra. Virahanka extended this work around the 6th century A.D., studying the number of ways of combining short and long syllables to create a meter of length n. Short syllables, marked S, take up one unit of length, while long syllables, marked $L$ , take two. Pingala found, for example, that there are five ways to construct a meter of length 4: $V _ { 4 } = { L L , S S L , S L S , L S S , S S S S }$ . Observe that we can split $V _ { 4 }$ into two subsets, those starting with $L$ and those starting with S, as shown in (1). \n(1) $V _ { 4 } ~ =$ LL, LSS i.e. L prefixed to each item of $V _ { 2 } ~ = ~ { mathsf { L } , ~ mathsf { S } mathsf { S } }$ SSL, SLS, SSSS i.e. S prefixed to each item of $V _ { 3 } ~ = ~ { { 5 } mathrm { { L } } , ~ mathrm { { L 5 } } , ~ mathsf { { S 5 } } }$ \nWith this observation, we can write a little recursive function called virahanka1() to compute these meters, shown in Example 4-9. Notice that, in order to compute $V _ { 4 }$ we first compute $V _ { 3 }$ and $V _ { 2 }$ . But to compute $V _ { 3 }$ , we need to first compute $V _ { 2 }$ and $V _ { 1 }$ . This call structure is depicted in (2).",

Observe that we can split $V _ { 4 }$ into two subsets, those starting with $L$ and those starting with S, as shown in (1). \n(1) $V _ { 4 } ~ =$ LL, LSS i.e. L prefixed to each item of $V _ { 2 } ~ = ~ { mathsf { L } , ~ mathsf { S } mathsf { S } }$ SSL, SLS, SSSS i.e. S prefixed to each item of $V _ { 3 } ~ = ~ { { 5 } mathrm { { L } } , ~ mathrm { { L 5 } } , ~ mathsf { { S 5 } } }$ \nWith this observation, we can write a little recursive function called virahanka1() to compute these meters, shown in Example 4-9. Notice that, in order to compute $V _ { 4 }$ we first compute $V _ { 3 }$ and $V _ { 2 }$ . But to compute $V _ { 3 }$ , we need to first compute $V _ { 2 }$ and $V _ { 1 }$ . This call structure is depicted in (2). \nExample 4-9. Four ways to compute Sanskrit meter: (i) iterative, (ii) bottom-up dynamic programming, (iii) top-down dynamic programming, and (iv) built-in memoization. \ndef virahanka1(n): if $mathfrak { n }  =  0$ : return [\"\"] elif $textsf { n } = = textsf { 1 }$ : return [\"S\"] else: $mathsf { textbf { S } } = bigl [ mathsf {  \" { S } } ^ { boldsymbol {  \" } } bigr + mathsf { Omega }$ prosody for prosody in virahanka1(n-1)] l = [\"L\" + prosody for prosody in virahanka1(n-2)] return $textsf { s } + 1$   \ndef virahanka2(n): lookup $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [[\"\"], [\"S\"]] for i in range(n-1): $mathsf { textbf { S } } = mathsf  [  \" { S } ^ {  \" } +  \" { Gamma } ( mathrm { Omega } ) bullet mathrm { Gamma } ( mathrm { Omega } ) bullet mathrm { Gamma } ( mathrm { textbf { S } } ^ { - } ) mathrm { [ frac { ddot { Omega } } { tau } ] } mathrm { Omega }$ prosody for prosody in lookup[i+1]] $mathsf { Lambda } = mathsf { Lambda } [ \" mathsf { L } ^ { mathsf { Pi } } + mathsf { Lambda }$ prosody for prosody in lookup[i]] lookup.append $( s  +  1 )$ return lookup[n]   \ndef virahanka3 $( mathsf { n } , mathsf { mathrm {  ~  l o o k u p { = } } } { 0 : [ { mathsf { n } } ^ { mathsf { u } } ] , mathsf { Omega } 1 : [ { mathsf { n } } ^ { mathsf { u } } mathsf { S } ^ { mathsf { u } } ] } ) :$ if n not in lookup: $mathsf { textbf { S } } = bigl [ mathsf {  \" { S } } ^ { boldsymbol {  \" } } bigr + mathsf { Omega }$ prosody for prosody in virahanka3(n-1)] $mathsf { Lambda } = mathsf { Lambda } [ \" mathsf { L } ^ { mathsf { Pi } } + mathsf { Lambda }$ prosody for prosody in virahanka3 $( n - 2 ) .$ i $mathsf { l o o k u p [ n ] ~ = ~ mathsf { s } ~ + ~ 1 ~ }$ return lookup[n]   \nfrom nltk import memoize   \n@memoize   \ndef virahanka4(n): if $mathfrak { n }  =  0$ : return [\"\"] elif $textsf { n } = = textsf { 1 }$ : return [\"S\"] else: $mathsf { textbf { S } } = bigl [ mathsf {  \" { S } } ^ { mathsf { \" } } bigr + mathsf { Omega }$ prosody for prosody in virahanka4(n-1)] $mathsf { Lambda } = mathsf { Lambda } [ \" mathsf { L } ^ { mathsf { Pi } } + mathsf { Lambda }$ prosody for prosody in virahanka4(n-2)] return $textsf { s } + 1$   \n>>> virahanka1(4)   \n$begin{array} { r l } & { gamma > gamma mathrm { ~ v } bot mathrm { t } mathrm { d } mathrm { n } { sf d } mathrm { n } { sf d } mathrm { sf 1 } ( mathrm { d } { sf 1 } mathrm { e } mathrm { d } mathrm { sf 2 } mathrm { sf prime } ) }  & { mathrm { [ ~ bar { ~ } S S S bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } S S mathrm { bf ~ { bar { ~ } } S S mathrm { bf ~ { bar { ~ } } S S mathrm { bf ~ { bar { ~ } } S S mathrm { bf ~ { bar { ~ } } S S mathrm { bf ~ { bar { ~ } } Lambda } } } } ] } ~ , ~ } }  & { gamma > mathrm { ~ v } mathrm { ~ v } mathrm { ~ i } mathrm { r a n h a n h } mathrm { ~ a n } 2 ( 4 ) }  & { mathrm { [ ~ bar { ~ } S S S S bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } S S L bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } S S L bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } S L S bar { ~ } mathrm { bf { ~ } bar { ~ } S bar { ~ } L S bar { ~ } mathrm { bf ~ { bar { ~ } L } L bar { ~ } bar { ~ } I ~ } } ] ~ } }  & { mathrm { ~ gamma > gamma ~ v i r a h a n h a n } mathrm { ~ a n } 3 ( 4 ) }  &  mathrm { [ ~ bar { ~ } S S S S bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } bar { ~ } S S L bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } S L S bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } S L S bar { ~ } mathrm { bf { ~ } S bar { ~ } L S bar { ~ } mathrm { bf { ~ } bar { ~ } L S bar { ~ } bar { } mathrm { bf ~ { bar { ~ } L } L bar { ~ } bar { } bar { ~ } I ~ } } ] ~ } }  & { mathrm { ~ gamma > gamma ~ v i r a h a n h a d ( 4 ) } }  & { mathrm { [ ~ bar { ~ } S S S S bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } S S L bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } S L S bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } L S bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } L S bar { ~ } , ~ bar { ~ } L L bar { ~ } mathrm { bf { bar { ~ } } I ~ } ] ~ } } end{array}$ \nV4 V3 V2 X V2 V1 V1 VO 人 v1vo \nAs you can see, $V _ { 2 }$ is computed twice. This might not seem like a significant problem, but it turns out to be rather wasteful as $n$ gets large: to compute $V _ { 2 0 }$ using this recursive technique, we would compute $V _ { 2 }$ 4,181 times; and for $V _ { 4 0 }$ we would compute $V _ { 2 }$ 63,245,986 times! A much better alternative is to store the value of $V _ { 2 }$ in a table and look it up whenever we need it. The same goes for other values, such as $V _ { 3 }$ and so on. Function virahanka2() implements a dynamic programming approach to the problem. It works by filling up a table (called lookup) with solutions to all smaller instances of the problem, stopping as soon as we reach the value we’re interested in. At this point we read off the value and return it. Crucially, each subproblem is only ever solved once. \nNotice that the approach taken in virahanka2() is to solve smaller problems on the way to solving larger problems. Accordingly, this is known as the bottom-up approach to dynamic programming. Unfortunately it turns out to be quite wasteful for some applications, since it may compute solutions to sub-problems that are never required for solving the main problem. This wasted computation can be avoided using the topdown approach to dynamic programming, which is illustrated in the function vira hanka3() in Example 4-9. Unlike the bottom-up approach, this approach is recursive. It avoids the huge wastage of virahanka1() by checking whether it has previously stored the result. If not, it computes the result recursively and stores it in the table. The last step is to return the stored result. The final method, in virahanka4(), is to use a Python “decorator” called memoize, which takes care of the housekeeping work done by virahanka3() without cluttering up the program. This “memoization” process stores the result of each previous call to the function along with the parameters that were used. If the function is subsequently called with the same parameters, it returns the stored result instead of recalculating it. (This aspect of Python syntax is beyond the scope of this book.) \nThis concludes our brief introduction to dynamic programming. We will encounter it again in Section 8.4. \n4.8  A Sample of Python Libraries \nPython has hundreds of third-party libraries, specialized software packages that extend the functionality of Python. NLTK is one such library. To realize the full power of Python programming, you should become familiar with several other libraries. Most of these will need to be manually installed on your computer.",

        "content": "Matplotlib \nPython has some libraries that are useful for visualizing language data. The Matplotlib package supports sophisticated plotting functions with a MATLAB-style interface, and is available from http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/. \nSo far we have focused on textual presentation and the use of formatted print statements to get output lined up in columns. It is often very useful to display numerical data in graphical form, since this often makes it easier to detect patterns. For example, in Example 3-5, we saw a table of numbers showing the frequency of particular modal verbs in the Brown Corpus, classified by genre. The program in Example 4-10 presents the same information in graphical format. The output is shown in Figure 4-4 (a color figure in the graphical display). \nExample 4-10. Frequency of modals in different sections of the Brown Corpus. \ncolors $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'rgbcmyk' # red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, black   \ndef bar_chart(categories, words, counts): \"Plot a bar chart showing counts for each word by category\" import pylab ind $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ pylab.arange(len(words)) width = 1 / (len(categories) + 1) bar_groups $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [] for c in range(len(categories)): bars $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ pylab.bar(ind+c*width, counts[categories[c]], width, color $mathbf { bar { rho } } = mathbf { rho }$ colors[c % len(colors)]) bar_groups.append(bars) pylab.xticks(ind+width, words) pylab.legend([b[0] for b in bar_groups], categories, loc $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ 'upper left') pylab.ylabel('Frequency') pylab.title('Frequency of Six Modal Verbs by Genre') pylab.show()   \n>>> genres $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['news', 'religion', 'hobbies', 'government', 'adventure']   \n>>> modals $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['can', 'could', 'may', 'might', 'must', 'will']   \n>>> cfdist $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist( (genre, word) for genre in genres for word in nltk.corpus.brown.words(categories $ O =$ genre) if word in modals)   \n>>> counts $= { }$   \n>>> for genre in genres: counts[genre] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [cfdist[genre][word] for word in modals]   \n>>> bar_chart(genres, modals, counts) \nFrom the bar chart it is immediately obvious that may and must have almost identical relative frequencies. The same goes for could and might. \nIt is also possible to generate such data visualizations on the fly. For example, a web page with form input could permit visitors to specify search parameters, submit the form, and see a dynamically generated visualization. To do this we have to specify the \nAgg backend for matplotlib, which is a library for producing raster (pixel) images $bullet$ . Next, we use all the same PyLab methods as before, but instead of displaying the result on a graphical terminal using pylab.show(), we save it to a file using pylab.savefig() . We specify the filename and dpi, then print HTML markup that directs the web browser to load the file. \n>>> import matplotlib   \n>>> matplotlib.use('Agg')   \n>>> pylab.savefig('modals.png')   \n>>> print 'Content-Type: text/html'   \n>>> print   \n>>> print '<html><body>'   \n>>> print '<img src $ c =$ \"modals.png\"/>'   \n>>> print '</body></html>' \nNetworkX \nThe NetworkX package is for defining and manipulating structures consisting of nodes and edges, known as graphs. It is available from https://networkx.lanl.gov/. NetworkX can be used in conjunction with Matplotlib to visualize networks, such as WordNet (the semantic network we introduced in Section 2.5). The program in Example 4-11 initializes an empty graph $bullet$ and then traverses the WordNet hypernym hierarchy adding edges to the graph $bullet$ . Notice that the traversal is recursive $pmb { theta }$ , applying the programming technique discussed in Section 4.7. The resulting display is shown in Figure 4-5.",

This distinction parallels the typetoken distinction.   \n• Strings, lists, and tuples are different kinds of sequence object, supporting common operations such as indexing, slicing, len(), sorted(), and membership testing using in.   \n• We can write text to a file by opening the file for writing ofile $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ open('output.txt', 'w' then adding content to the file ofile.write(\"Monty Python\"), and finally closing the file ofile.close().   \n• A declarative programming style usually produces more compact, readable code; manually incremented loop variables are usually unnecessary. When a sequence must be enumerated, use enumerate().   \n• Functions are an essential programming abstraction: key concepts to understand are parameter passing, variable scope, and docstrings. \n• A function serves as a namespace: names defined inside a function are not visible outside that function, unless those names are declared to be global. • Modules permit logically related material to be localized in a file. A module serves as a namespace: names defined in a module—such as variables and functions— are not visible to other modules, unless those names are imported. • Dynamic programming is an algorithm design technique used widely in NLP that stores the results of previous computations in order to avoid unnecessary recomputation. \n4.10  Further Reading \nThis chapter has touched on many topics in programming, some specific to Python, and some quite general. We’ve just scratched the surface, and you may want to read more about these topics, starting with the further materials for this chapter available at http://www.nltk.org/. \nThe Python website provides extensive documentation. It is important to understand the built-in functions and standard types, described at http://docs.python.org/library/ functions.html and http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html. We have learned about generators and their importance for efficiency; for information about iterators, a closely related topic, see http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html. Consult your favorite Python book for more information on such topics. An excellent resource for using Python for multimedia processing, including working with sound files, is (Guzdial, 2005). \nWhen using the online Python documentation, be aware that your installed version might be different from the version of the documentation you are reading. You can easily check what version you have, with import sys; sys.version. Version-specific documentation is available at http://www.python.org/doc/versions/. \nAlgorithm design is a rich field within computer science. Some good starting points are (Harel, 2004), (Levitin, 2004), and (Knuth, 2006). Useful guidance on the practice of software development is provided in (Hunt & Thomas, 2000) and (McConnell, 2004). \n4.11  Exercises \n1. ○ Find out more about sequence objects using Python’s help facility. In the interpreter, type help(str), help(list), and help(tuple). This will give you a full list of the functions supported by each type. Some functions have special names flanked with underscores; as the help documentation shows, each such function corresponds to something more familiar. For example x.__getitem__(y) is just a longwinded way of saying x[y].   \n2. $scriptscriptstyle mathrm { ~ o ~ }$ Identify three operations that can be performed on both tuples and lists. Identify three list operations that cannot be performed on tuples. Name a context where using a list instead of a tuple generates a Python error. 3. ○ Find out how to create a tuple consisting of a single item. There are at least two ways to do this. 4. ○ Create a list words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['is', 'NLP', 'fun', '?']. Use a series of assignment statements (e.g., words[1] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ words[2]) and a temporary variable tmp to transform this list into the list ['NLP', 'is', 'fun', '!']. Now do the same transformation using tuple assignment.   \n5. $scriptscriptstyle mathrm { ~ o ~ }$ Read about the built-in comparison function cmp, by typing help(cmp). How does it differ in behavior from the comparison operators? 6. ○ Does the method for creating a sliding window of n-grams behave correctly for the two limiting cases: $n = 1$ and $n = mathrm { 1 e n ( s e n t ) } ;$ ? 7. ○ We pointed out that when empty strings and empty lists occur in the condition part of an if clause, they evaluate to False. In this case, they are said to be occurring in a Boolean context. Experiment with different kinds of non-Boolean expressions in Boolean contexts, and see whether they evaluate as True or False.   \n8. ○ Use the inequality operators to compare strings, e.g., 'Monty' < 'Python'. What happens when you do 'Z' < 'a'? Try pairs of strings that have a common prefix, e.g., 'Monty' < 'Montague'. Read up on “lexicographical sort” in order to understand what is going on here. Try comparing structured objects, e.g., ('Monty', 1) < ('Monty', 2). Does this behave as expected? 9. $bigcirc$ Write code that removes whitespace at the beginning and end of a string, and normalizes whitespace between words to be a single-space character. a. Do this task using split() and join(). b. Do this task using regular expression substitutions.   \n10. ○ Write a program to sort words by length. Define a helper function cmp_len which uses the cmp comparison function on word lengths.   \n11. ◑ Create a list of words and store it in a variable sent1. Now assign sent2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sent1. Modify one of the items in sent1 and verify that sent2 has changed. a. Now try the same exercise, but instead assign sent2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ sent1[:]. Modify sent1 again and see what happens to sent2. Explain. b. Now define text1 to be a list of lists of strings (e.g., to represent a text consisting of multiple sentences). Now assign text2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ text1[:], assign a new value to one of the words, e.g., text1[1][1] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Monty'. Check what this did to text2.

Load Python’s deepcopy() function (i.e., from copy import deepcopy), consult its documentation, and test that it makes a fresh copy of any object. \n\n12. $mathbf { 0 }$ Initialize an $n$ -by- $m$ list of lists of empty strings using list multiplication, e.g., word_table $mathbf { Sigma } = ~ [ [ mathbf { Sigma } ^ { prime prime } ] ~ ^ { * } ~ mathfrak { n } ] ~ ^ { * } ~ mathfrak { m } .$ . What happens when you set one of its values, e.g., word_table[1][2] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"hello\"? Explain why this happens. Now write an expression using range() to construct a list of lists, and show that it does not have this problem. \n13. ◑ Write code to initialize a two-dimensional array of sets called word_vowels and process a list of words, adding each word to word_vowels[l][v] where l is the length of the word and $mathsf { v }$ is the number of vowels it contains. \n14. $mathbf { 0 }$ Write a function novel10(text) that prints any word that appeared in the last $10 %$ of a text that had not been encountered earlier.   \n15. ◑ Write a program that takes a sentence expressed as a single string, splits it, and counts up the words. Get it to print out each word and the word’s frequency, one per line, in alphabetical order.   \n16. $mathbf { 0 }$ Read up on Gematria, a method for assigning numbers to words, and for mapping between words having the same number to discover the hidden meaning of texts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria, http://essenes.net/gemcal.htm). a. Write a function gematria() that sums the numerical values of the letters of a word, according to the letter values in letter_vals: >>> letter_vals $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3, 'd':4, 'e':5, 'f':80, 'g':3, 'h':8, ... 'i':10, 'j':10, 'k':20, 'l':30, 'm':40, 'n':50, 'o':70, 'p':80, 'q':100, . 'r':200, 's':300, 't':400, 'u':6, 'v':6, 'w':800, 'x':60, 'y':10, 'z':7} b. Process a corpus (e.g., nltk.corpus.state_union) and for each document, count how many of its words have the number 666. c. Write a function decode() to process a text, randomly replacing words with their Gematria equivalents, in order to discover the “hidden meaning” of the text.   \n17. ◑ Write a function shorten(text, n) to process a text, omitting the $n$ most frequently occurring words of the text. How readable is it?   \n18. ◑ Write code to print out an index for a lexicon, allowing someone to look up words according to their meanings (or their pronunciations; whatever properties are contained in the lexical entries).   \n19. ◑ Write a list comprehension that sorts a list of WordNet synsets for proximity to a given synset. For example, given the synsets minke_whale.n.01, orca.n.01, novel.n.01, and tortoise.n.01, sort them according to their path_distance() from right_whale.n.01.   \n20. ◑ Write a function that takes a list of words (containing duplicates) and returns a list of words (with no duplicates) sorted by decreasing frequency. E.g., if the input list contained 10 instances of the word table and 9 instances of the word chair, then table would appear before chair in the output list.   \n21. ◑ Write a function that takes a text and a vocabulary as its arguments and returns the set of words that appear in the text but not in the vocabulary. Both arguments can be represented as lists of strings. Can you do this in a single line, using set.dif ference()?   \n22. $mathbf { 0 }$ Import the itemgetter() function from the operator module in Python’s standard library (i.e., from operator import itemgetter). Create a list words containing sev\neral words. Now try calling: sorted(words, key=itemgetter(1)), and sor ted(words, key=itemgetter(-1)). Explain what itemgetter() is doing. \n23. ◑ Write a recursive function lookup(trie, key) that looks up a key in a trie, and returns the value it finds. Extend the function to return a word when it is uniquely determined by its prefix (e.g., vanguard is the only word that starts with vang-, so lookup(trie, 'vang') should return the same thing as lookup(trie, 'vanguard')). \n24. ◑ Read up on “keyword linkage” (Chapter 5 of (Scott & Tribble, 2006)). Extract keywords from NLTK’s Shakespeare Corpus and using the NetworkX package, plot keyword linkage networks. \n25. ◑ Read about string edit distance and the Levenshtein Algorithm. Try the implementation provided in nltk.edit_dist(). In what way is this using dynamic programming? Does it use the bottom-up or top-down approach? (See also http:// norvig.com/spell-correct.html.) \n26. $mathbf { 0 }$ The Catalan numbers arise in many applications of combinatorial mathematics, including the counting of parse trees (Section 8.6). The series can be defined as follows: $C _ { 0 } = 1$ , and $boldsymbol { C } _ { n + 1 } = boldsymbol { Sigma } _ { 0 dots n } left( boldsymbol { C } _ { i } boldsymbol { C } _ { n - i } right)$ . \na. Write a recursive function to compute nth Catalan number $C _ { n }$ .   \nb. Now write another function that does this computation using dynamic programming.   \nc. Use the timeit module to compare the performance of these functions as $n$ increases. \n27. $bullet$ Reproduce some of the results of (Zhao & Zobel, 2007) concerning authorship identification. \n28. ● Study gender-specific lexical choice, and see if you can reproduce some of the results of http://www.clintoneast.com/articles/words.php. \n29. ● Write a recursive function that pretty prints a trie in alphabetically sorted order, for example: \nchair: 'flesh' ---t: 'cat' --ic: 'stylish' ---en: 'dog' \n30. ● With the help of the trie data structure, write a recursive function that processes text, locating the uniqueness point in each word, and discarding the remainder of each word. How much compression does this give? How readable is the resulting text? \n31. $bullet$ Obtain some raw text, in the form of a single, long string. Use Python’s text wrap module to break it up into multiple lines. Now write code to add extra spaces between words, in order to justify the output. Each line must have the same width, and spaces must be approximately evenly distributed across each line. No line can begin or end with a space. \n32. $bullet$ Develop a simple extractive summarization tool, that prints the sentences of a document which contain the highest total word frequency. Use FreqDist() to count word frequencies, and use sum to sum the frequencies of the words in each sentence. Rank the sentences according to their score. Finally, print the $n$ highest-scoring sentences in document order. Carefully review the design of your program, especially your approach to this double sorting. Make sure the program is written as clearly as possible.   \n33. ● Develop your own NgramTagger class that inherits from NLTK’s class, and which encapsulates the method of collapsing the vocabulary of the tagged training and testing data that was described in Chapter 5. Make sure that the unigram and default backoff taggers have access to the full vocabulary.   \n34. ● Read the following article on semantic orientation of adjectives. Use the NetworkX package to visualize a network of adjectives with edges to indicate same versus different semantic orientation (see http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P97 -1023).   \n35. ● Design an algorithm to find the “statistically improbable phrases” of a document collection (see http://www.amazon.com/gp/search-inside/sipshelp.html).   \n36. ● Write a program to implement a brute-force algorithm for discovering word squares, a kind of $n times n$ : crossword in which the entry in the nth row is the same as the entry in the nth column. For discussion, see http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/ languagelog/archives/002679.html. \nCategorizing and Tagging Words \nBack in elementary school you learned the difference between nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. These “word classes” are not just the idle invention of grammarians, but are useful categories for many language processing tasks. As we will see, they arise from simple analysis of the distribution of words in text. The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions: \n1. What are lexical categories, and how are they used in natural language processing?   \n2. What is a good Python data structure for storing words and their categories?   \n3. How can we automatically tag each word of a text with its word class? \nAlong the way, we’ll cover some fundamental techniques in NLP, including sequence labeling, n-gram models, backoff, and evaluation. These techniques are useful in many areas, and tagging gives us a simple context in which to present them. We will also see how tagging is the second step in the typical NLP pipeline, following tokenization. \nThe process of classifying words into their parts-of-speech and labeling them accordingly is known as part-of-speech tagging, POS tagging, or simply tagging. Partsof-speech are also known as word classes or lexical categories. The collection of tags used for a particular task is known as a tagset. Our emphasis in this chapter is on exploiting tags, and tagging text automatically. \n5.1  Using a Tagger \nA part-of-speech tagger, or POS tagger, processes a sequence of words, and attaches a part of speech tag to each word (don’t forget to import nltk): \n>>> text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.word_tokenize(\"And now for something completely different\")   \n>>> nltk.pos_tag(text)   \n[('And', 'CC'), ('now', 'RB'), ('for', 'IN'), ('something', 'NN'),   \n('completely', 'RB'), ('different', 'JJ')] \nHere we see that and is CC, a coordinating conjunction; now and completely are RB, or adverbs; for is IN, a preposition; something is NN, a noun; and different is JJ, an adjective.",

Some corpora have README files with tagset documentation; see nltk.name.readme(), substituting in the name of the corpus. \nLet’s look at another example, this time including some homonyms: \n>>> text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.word_tokenize(\"They refuse to permit us to obtain the refuse permit\") >>> nltk.pos_tag(text) [('They', 'PRP'), ('refuse', 'VBP'), ('to', 'TO'), ('permit', 'VB'), ('us', 'PRP'), ('to', 'TO'), ('obtain', 'VB'), ('the', 'DT'), ('refuse', 'NN'), ('permit', 'NN')] \nNotice that refuse and permit both appear as a present tense verb (VBP) and a noun (NN). E.g., refUSE is a verb meaning “deny,” while REFuse is a noun meaning “trash” (i.e., they are not homophones). Thus, we need to know which word is being used in order to pronounce the text correctly. (For this reason, text-to-speech systems usually perform POS tagging.) \nYour Turn: Many words, like ski and race, can be used as nouns or verbs with no difference in pronunciation. Can you think of others? Hint: think of a commonplace object and try to put the word to before it to see if it can also be a verb, or think of an action and try to put the before it to see if it can also be a noun. Now make up a sentence with both uses of this word, and run the POS tagger on this sentence. \nLexical categories like “noun” and part-of-speech tags like NN seem to have their uses, but the details will be obscure to many readers. You might wonder what justification there is for introducing this extra level of information. Many of these categories arise from superficial analysis of the distribution of words in text. Consider the following analysis involving woman (a noun), bought (a verb), over (a preposition), and the (a determiner). The text.similar() method takes a word $boldsymbol { w }$ , finds all contexts $w _ { 1 } w _ {  } w _ { 2 }$ , then finds all words $w ^ { prime }$ that appear in the same context, i.e. $w _ { 1 } w ^ { prime } w _ { 2 }$ . \n>>> text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Text(word.lower() for word in nltk.corpus.brown.words()) >>> text.similar('woman')   \nBuilding word-context index..   \nman time day year car moment world family house country child boy state job way war girl place room word   \n>>> text.similar('bought')   \nmade said put done seen had found left given heard brought got been was set told took in felt that   \n>>> text.similar('over')   \nin on to of and for with from at by that into as up out down through is all about   \n>>> text.similar('the')   \na his this their its her an that our any all one these my in your no some other and \nObserve that searching for woman finds nouns; searching for bought mostly finds verbs; searching for over generally finds prepositions; searching for the finds several determiners. A tagger can correctly identify the tags on these words in the context of a sentence, e.g., The woman bought over $$ 150,000$ worth of clothes. \nA tagger can also model our knowledge of unknown words; for example, we can guess that scrobbling is probably a verb, with the root scrobble, and likely to occur in contexts like he was scrobbling. \n5.2  Tagged Corpora \nRepresenting Tagged Tokens \nBy convention in NLTK, a tagged token is represented using a tuple consisting of the token and the tag. We can create one of these special tuples from the standard string representation of a tagged token, using the function str2tuple(): \n>>> tagged_token $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.tag.str2tuple('fly/NN')   \n>>> tagged_token   \n('fly', 'NN')   \n>>> tagged_token[0]   \n'fly'   \n>>> tagged_token[1]   \n'NN' \nWe can construct a list of tagged tokens directly from a string. The first step is to tokenize the string to access the individual word/tag strings, and then to convert each of these into a tuple (using str2tuple()). \n>>> sent $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ The/AT grand/JJ jury/NN commented/VBD on/IN a/AT number/NN of/IN other/AP topics/NNS ,/, AMONG/IN them/PPO the/AT Atlanta/NP and/CC Fulton/NP-tl County/NN-tl purchasing/VBG departments/NNS which/WDT it/PPS said/VBD ``/`` ARE/BER well/QL operated/VBN and/CC follow/VB generally/RB accepted/VBN practices/NNS which/WDT inure/VB to/IN the/AT best/JJT interest/NN of/IN both/ABX governments/NNS ''/'' ./.   \n>>> [nltk.tag.str2tuple(t) for t in sent.split()]   \n[('The', 'AT'), ('grand', 'JJ'), ('jury', 'NN'), ('commented', 'VBD'),   \n('on', 'IN'), ('a', 'AT'), ('number', 'NN'), ... ('.', '.')] \nReading Tagged Corpora \nSeveral of the corpora included with NLTK have been tagged for their part-of-speech. Here’s an example of what you might see if you opened a file from the Brown Corpus with a text editor: \nThe/at Fulton/np-tl County/nn-tl Grand/jj-tl Jury/nn-tl said/vbd Friday/nr an/at investigation/nn of/in Atlanta’s/np$ recent/jj primary/nn election/nn produced/vbd / no/at evidence/nn ''/'' that/cs any/dti irregularities/nns took/vbd place/nn ./.",

NLTK’s corpus readers provide a uniform interface so that you don’t have to be concerned with the different file formats. In contrast with the file extract just shown, the corpus reader for the Brown Corpus represents the data as shown next. Note that part-of-speech tags have been converted to uppercase; this has become standard practice since the Brown Corpus was published. \n>>> nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words() [('The', 'AT'), ('Fulton', 'NP-TL'), ('County', 'NN-TL'), ...] >>> nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words(simplify_tags=True) [('The', 'DET'), ('Fulton', 'N'), ('County', 'N'), ...] \nWhenever a corpus contains tagged text, the NLTK corpus interface will have a tagged_words() method. Here are some more examples, again using the output format illustrated for the Brown Corpus: \n>>> print nltk.corpus.nps_chat.tagged_words() [('now', 'RB'), ('im', 'PRP'), ('left', 'VBD'), . >>> nltk.corpus.conll2000.tagged_words() [('Confidence', 'NN'), ('in', 'IN'), ('the', 'DT'), ...] >>> nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_words() [('Pierre', 'NNP'), ('Vinken', 'NNP'), (',', ','), ...] \nNot all corpora employ the same set of tags; see the tagset help functionality and the readme() methods mentioned earlier for documentation. Initially we want to avoid the complications of these tagsets, so we use a built-in mapping to a simplified tagset: \n>>> nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words(simplify_tags=True) [('The', 'DET'), ('Fulton', 'NP'), ('County', 'N'), >>> nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_words(simplify_tags=True) [('Pierre', 'NP'), ('Vinken', 'NP'), (',', ',') \nTagged corpora for several other languages are distributed with NLTK, including Chinese, Hindi, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and Catalan. These usually contain nonASCII text, and Python always displays this in hexadecimal when printing a larger structure such as a list. \n>>> nltk.corpus.sinica_treebank.tagged_words()   \n[('xe4xb8x80', 'Neu'), ('xe5x8fx8bxe6x83x85', 'Nad'), ...]   \n>>> nltk.corpus.indian.tagged_words()   \n[('xe0xa6xaexe0xa6xb9xe0xa6xbfxe0xa6xb7xe0xa7x87xe0xa6xb0', 'NN'),   \n('xe0xa6xb8xe0xa6xa8xe0xa7x8dxe0xa6xa4xe0xa6xbexe0xa6xa8', 'NN'),   \n>>> nltk.corpus.mac_morpho.tagged_words()   \n[('Jersei', 'N'), ('atinge', 'V'), ('mxe9dia', 'N'), ...]   \n>>> nltk.corpus.conll2002.tagged_words()   \n[('Sao', 'NC'), ('Paulo', 'VMI'), ('(', 'Fpa'), ...]   \n>>> nltk.corpus.cess_cat.tagged_words()   \n[('El', 'da0ms0'), ('Tribunal_Suprem', 'np0000o'), ...] \nIf your environment is set up correctly, with appropriate editors and fonts, you should be able to display individual strings in a human-readable way. For example, Figure 5-1 shows data accessed using nltk.corpus.indian. \nIf the corpus is also segmented into sentences, it will have a tagged_sents() method that divides up the tagged words into sentences rather than presenting them as one big list. This will be useful when we come to developing automatic taggers, as they are trained and tested on lists of sentences, not words. \nA Simplified Part-of-Speech Tagset \nTagged corpora use many different conventions for tagging words.

Nouns can appear after determiners and adjectives, and can be the subject or object of the verb, as shown in Table 5-2. \nThe simplified noun tags are N for common nouns like book, and NP for proper nouns like Scotland. \nLet’s inspect some tagged text to see what parts-of-speech occur before a noun, with the most frequent ones first. To begin with, we construct a list of bigrams whose members are themselves word-tag pairs, such as (('The', 'DET'), ('Fulton', 'NP')) and (('Fulton', 'NP'), ('County', 'N')). Then we construct a FreqDist from the tag parts of the bigrams. \n>>> word_tag_pairs $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.bigrams(brown_news_tagged) >>> list(nltk.FreqDist(a[1] for (a, b) in word_tag_pairs if b[1] == 'N')) ['DET', 'ADJ', 'N', 'P', 'NP', 'NUM', 'V', 'PRO', 'CNJ', ,', 'VG', 'VN', ...] \nThis confirms our assertion that nouns occur after determiners and adjectives, including numeral adjectives (tagged as NUM). \nVerbs \nVerbs are words that describe events and actions, e.g., fall and eat, as shown in Table 5-3. In the context of a sentence, verbs typically express a relation involving the referents of one or more noun phrases. \nWhat are the most common verbs in news text? Let’s sort all the verbs by frequency: \n>>> wsj $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_words(simplify_tags $ v =$ True)>>> word_tag_fd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FreqDist(wsj)$gg >$ [word $^ +$ \"/\" $^ +$ tag for (word, tag) in word_tag_fd if tag.startswith('V')]['is/V', 'said/VD', 'was/VD', 'are/V', 'be/V', 'has/V', 'have/V', 'says/V','were/VD', 'had/VD', 'been/VN', \"'s/V\", 'do/V', 'say/V', 'make/V', 'did/VD','rose/VD', 'does/V', 'expected/VN', 'buy/V', 'take/V', 'get/V', 'sell/V','help/V', 'added/VD', 'including/VG', 'according/VG', 'made/VN', 'pay/V', ...]\nNote that the items being counted in the frequency distribution are word-tag pairs. Since words and tags are paired, we can treat the word as a condition and the tag as an event, and initialize a conditional frequency distribution with a list of condition-event pairs. This lets us see a frequency-ordered list of tags given a word: \n>>> cfd1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(wsj)   \n>>> cfd1['yield'].keys()   \n['V', 'N']   \n>>> cfd1['cut'].keys()   \n['V', 'VD', 'N', 'VN'] \nWe can reverse the order of the pairs, so that the tags are the conditions, and the words are the events.

Is this generally true? \nYour Turn: Given the list of past participles specified by cfd2['VN'].keys(), try to collect a list of all the word-tag pairs that immediately precede items in that list. \nAdjectives and Adverbs \nTwo other important word classes are adjectives and adverbs. Adjectives describe nouns, and can be used as modifiers (e.g., large in the large pizza), or as predicates (e.g., the pizza is large). English adjectives can have internal structure (e.g., fall+ing in the falling stocks). Adverbs modify verbs to specify the time, manner, place, or direction of the event described by the verb (e.g., quickly in the stocks fell quickly). Adverbs may also modify adjectives (e.g., really in Mary’s teacher was really nice). \nEnglish has several categories of closed class words in addition to prepositions, such as articles (also often called determiners) (e.g., the, a), modals (e.g., should, may), and personal pronouns (e.g., she, they). Each dictionary and grammar classifies these words differently. \nYour Turn: If you are uncertain about some of these parts-of-speech, study them using nltk.app.concordance(), or watch some of the Schoolhouse Rock! grammar videos available at YouTube, or consult Section 5.9.",

Is this generally true? \nYour Turn: Given the list of past participles specified by cfd2['VN'].keys(), try to collect a list of all the word-tag pairs that immediately precede items in that list. \nAdjectives and Adverbs \nTwo other important word classes are adjectives and adverbs. Adjectives describe nouns, and can be used as modifiers (e.g., large in the large pizza), or as predicates (e.g., the pizza is large). English adjectives can have internal structure (e.g., fall+ing in the falling stocks). Adverbs modify verbs to specify the time, manner, place, or direction of the event described by the verb (e.g., quickly in the stocks fell quickly). Adverbs may also modify adjectives (e.g., really in Mary’s teacher was really nice). \nEnglish has several categories of closed class words in addition to prepositions, such as articles (also often called determiners) (e.g., the, a), modals (e.g., should, may), and personal pronouns (e.g., she, they). Each dictionary and grammar classifies these words differently. \nYour Turn: If you are uncertain about some of these parts-of-speech, study them using nltk.app.concordance(), or watch some of the Schoolhouse Rock! grammar videos available at YouTube, or consult Section 5.9. \nUnsimplified Tags \nLet’s find the most frequent nouns of each noun part-of-speech type. The program in Example 5-1 finds all tags starting with NN, and provides a few example words for each one. You will see that there are many variants of NN; the most important contain $$ 1$ for possessive nouns, S for plural nouns (since plural nouns typically end in $s$ ), and P for proper nouns.

Once we start doing part-of-speech tagging, we will be creating programs that assign a tag to a word, the tag which is most likely in a given context. We can think of this process as mapping from words to tags. The most natural way to store mappings in Python uses the so-called dictionary data type (also known as an associative array or hash array in other programming languages). In this section, we look at dictionaries and see how they can represent a variety of language information, including parts-of-speech. \nIndexing Lists Versus Dictionaries \nA text, as we have seen, is treated in Python as a list of words. An important property of lists is that we can “look up” a particular item by giving its index, e.g., text1[100]. Notice how we specify a number and get back a word. We can think of a list as a simple kind of table, as shown in Figure 5-2.",

We can think of a list as a simple kind of table, as shown in Figure 5-2. \nContrast this situation with frequency distributions (Section 1.3), where we specify a word and get back a number, e.g., fdist['monstrous'], which tells us the number of times a given word has occurred in a text. Lookup using words is familiar to anyone who has used a dictionary.

For example, a document index maps from a word (which we can represent as a string) to a list of pages (represented as a list of integers). In this section, we will see how to represent such mappings in Python. \nDictionaries in Python \nPython provides a dictionary data type that can be used for mapping between arbitrary types. It is like a conventional dictionary, in that it gives you an efficient way to look things up. However, as we see from Table 5-4, it has a much wider range of uses. \nTo illustrate, we define pos to be an empty dictionary and then add four entries to it, specifying the part-of-speech of some words. We add entries to a dictionary using the familiar square bracket notation: \n>>> pos = {}   \n>>> pos   \n{}   \n>>> pos['colorless'] = 'ADJ'   \n>>> pos   \n{'colorless': 'ADJ'}   \n>>> pos['ideas'] = 'N'   \n>>> pos['sleep'] = 'V'   \n>>> pos['furiously'] = 'ADV'   \n>>> pos   \n{'furiously': 'ADV', 'ideas': 'N', 'colorless': 'ADJ', 'sleep': 'V'} \nSo, for example, $bullet$ says that the part-of-speech of colorless is adjective, or more specifically, that the key 'colorless' is assigned the value 'ADJ' in dictionary pos. When we inspect the value of pos $bullet$ we see a set of key-value pairs. Once we have populated the dictionary in this way, we can employ the keys to retrieve values: \n>>> pos['ideas']   \n'N'   \n>>> pos['colorless']   \n'ADJ' \nOf course, we might accidentally use a key that hasn’t been assigned a value. \n>>> pos['green']   \nTraceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in ?   \nKeyError: 'green' \nThis raises an important question. Unlike lists and strings, where we can use len() to work out which integers will be legal indexes, how do we work out the legal keys for a dictionary? If the dictionary is not too big, we can simply inspect its contents by evaluating the variable pos. As we saw earlier in line $pmb { theta }$ , this gives us the key-value pairs. Notice that they are not in the same order they were originally entered; this is because dictionaries are not sequences but mappings (see Figure 5-3), and the keys are not inherently ordered. \nAlternatively, to just find the keys, we can either convert the dictionary to a list $bullet$ or use the dictionary in a context where a list is expected, as the parameter of sorted() $pmb { theta }$ or in a for loop $bullet$ . \n>>> list(pos)   \n['ideas', 'furiously', 'colorless', 'sleep'] >>> sorted(pos)   \n['colorless', 'furiously', 'ideas', 'sleep'] >>> [w for w in pos if w.endswith('s')] ['colorless', 'ideas'] \nAs well as iterating over all keys in the dictionary with a for loop, we can use the for loop as we did for printing lists: \n>>> for word in sorted(pos): print word $^ +$ \":\", pos[word]   \ncolorless: ADJ   \nfuriously: ADV   \nsleep: V   \nideas: N \nFinally, the dictionary methods keys(), values(), and items() allow us to access the keys, values, and key-value pairs as separate lists. We can even sort tuples $bullet$ , which orders them according to their first element (and if the first elements are the same, it uses their second elements). \n>>> pos.keys()   \n['colorless', 'furiously', 'sleep', 'ideas']   \n>>> pos.values()   \n['ADJ', 'ADV', 'V', 'N']   \n>>> pos.items()   \n[('colorless', 'ADJ'), ('furiously', 'ADV'), ('sleep', 'V'), ('ideas', 'N')]   \n>>> for key, val in sorted(pos.items()): print key $^ +$ \":\", val   \ncolorless: ADJ   \nfuriously: ADV   \nideas: N   \nsleep: V \nWe want to be sure that when we look something up in a dictionary, we get only one value for each key. Now suppose we try to use a dictionary to store the fact that the word sleep can be used as both a verb and a noun: \nInitially, pos['sleep'] is given the value $\" boldsymbol { nu } \"$ . But this is immediately overwritten with the new value, $\" N \"$ . In other words, there can be only one entry in the dictionary for 'sleep'. However, there is a way of storing multiple values in that entry: we use a list value, e.g., $mathsf { p o s } [ { bf sigma } ^ { prime } { sf s l e e p ^ { prime } } ] ~ = ~ [ { bf sigma } ^ { prime } { sf N ^ { prime } } , { bf sigma } ^ { prime } { sf V ^ { prime } } ]$ . In fact, this is what we saw in Section 2.4 for the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, which stores multiple pronunciations for a single word. \nDefining Dictionaries \nWe can use the same key-value pair format to create a dictionary. There are a couple of ways to do this, and we will normally use the first: \n>>> pos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ {'colorless': 'ADJ', 'ideas': 'N', 'sleep': 'V', 'furiously': 'ADV'} >>> pos = dict(colorless='ADJ', ideas='N', $mathsf { s l e e p } = \" boldsymbol { mathsf { V } } ^ { prime }$ , furiously='ADV') \nNote that dictionary keys must be immutable types, such as strings and tuples. If we try to define a dictionary using a mutable key, we get a TypeError: \n>>> pos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ {['ideas', 'blogs', 'adventures']: 'N'} Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> TypeError: list objects are unhashable \nDefault Dictionaries \nIf we try to access a key that is not in a dictionary, we get an error.

Each time we encounter a tag, we increment its count using the $+ =$ operator (see Example 5-3). \n\nExample 5-3. Incrementally updating a dictionary, and sorting by value. \n>>> counts $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.defaultdict(int)   \n>>> from nltk.corpus import brown   \n>>> for (word, tag) in brown.tagged_words(categories $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'news'): counts[tag] $+ =  1$   \n>>> counts['N']   \n22226   \n>>> list(counts)   \n['FW', 'DET', 'WH', , 'VBZ', 'VB+PPO', \"'\", ')', 'ADJ', 'PRO', '*' \n>>> from operator import itemgetter >>> sorted(counts.items(), key=itemgetter(1), reverse $ L =$ True) [('N', 22226), ('P', 10845), ('DET', 10648), ('NP', 8336), ('V', 7313), ...] >>> [t for t, c in sorted(counts.items(), key=itemgetter(1), reverse=True)] ['N', 'P', 'DET', 'NP', 'V', 'ADJ', 'CNJ', 'PRO', 'ADV', 'VD', ...] \nThe listing in Example 5-3 illustrates an important idiom for sorting a dictionary by its values, to show words in decreasing order of frequency. The first parameter of sorted() is the items to sort, which is a list of tuples consisting of a POS tag and a frequency. The second parameter specifies the sort key using a function itemget ter(). In general, itemgetter(n) returns a function that can be called on some other sequence object to obtain the nth element: \n>>> pair $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ('NP', 8336)   \n>>> pair[1]   \n8336   \n>>> itemgetter(1)(pair)   \n8336 \nThe last parameter of sorted() specifies that the items should be returned in reverse order, i.e., decreasing values of frequency. \nThere’s a second useful programming idiom at the beginning of Example 5-3, where we initialize a defaultdict and then use a for loop to update its values. Here’s a schematic version: \n>>> my_dictionary $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.defaultdict(function to create default value) >>> for item in sequence: my_dictionary[item_key] is updated with information about item \nHere’s another instance of this pattern, where we index words according to their last two letters: \n>>> last_letters $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.defaultdict(list)   \n>>> words $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.words.words('en')   \n>>> for word in words: key $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ word[-2:] last_letters[key].append(word)   \n>>> last_letters['ly']   \n['abactinally', 'abandonedly', 'abasedly', 'abashedly', 'abashlessly', 'abbreviately',   \n'abdominally', 'abhorrently', 'abidingly', 'abiogenetically', 'abiologically', ...]   \n>>> last_letters['zy']   \n['blazy', 'bleezy', 'blowzy', 'boozy', 'breezy', 'bronzy', 'buzzy', 'Chazy', ...] \n\nThe following example uses the same pattern to create an anagram dictionary. (You might experiment with the third line to get an idea of why this program works.) \n>>> anagrams $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.defaultdict(list)   \n>>> for word in words: key $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ''.join(sorted(word)) anagrams[key].append(word)   \n>>> anagrams['aeilnrt']   \n['entrail', 'latrine', 'ratline', 'reliant', 'retinal', 'trenail'] \nSince accumulating words like this is such a common task, NLTK provides a more convenient way of creating a defaultdict(list), in the form of nltk.Index(): \n>>> anagrams $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.Index((''.join(sorted(w)), w) for $w$ in words) >>> anagrams['aeilnrt'] ['entrail', 'latrine', 'ratline', 'reliant', 'retinal', 'trenail'] nltk.Index is a defaultdict(list) with extra support for initialization. Similarly, nltk.FreqDist is essentially a defaultdict(int) with extra support for initialization (along with sorting and plotting methods). \n\nComplex Keys and Values \nWe can use default dictionaries with complex keys and values. Let’s study the range of possible tags for a word, given the word itself and the tag of the previous word. We will see how this information can be used by a POS tagger. \n$gg >$ pos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.defaultdict(lambda: nltk.defaultdict(int))   \n$gg >$ brown_news_tagged $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown.tagged_words(categories $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ 'news', simplify_tags $ L =$ True)   \n>>> for ( $overline { { ( } } _ { mathsf { w } 1 } , overline { { mathtt { t } } } 1 )$ , (w2, t2)) in nltk.ibigrams(brown_news_tagged): $mathsf { p o s } [ left( mathsf { t } mathsf { 1 } , mathsf { Omega } mathsf { w } 2 right) ] [ mathsf { t } 2 ] mathsf { Omega } + mathsf { Omega } _ { 1 } mathsf { pmb { theta } }$   \n$begin{array} { r l } & { cdots }  & { mathrm { ~ gamma > ~ p o s [ ( { ' D E 7 ' } , ~ { ' r i g h t \" } ) ] ~ Theta } }  & { mathrm { d e f a u l t d i c t ( langle { langle Psi Psi ^ { bullet } ~ dot { underline { { i } } n t } ~ { ' } } rangle , ~ { ' } ^ { bullet } A D V \" : ~ 3 , ~ { ' } A D { mathbb { } } { mathbb { cdot } } ~ { mathbb { cdot } } ~ { mathbb { cdot } } ~ { mathbb { cdot } } ~ { mathbb { cdot } } ~ { mathbb { cdot } } ~ { mathbb { cdot } } ~ { mathbb { cdot } } ~ { mathbb { cdot } } ~ { 3 } } ) } } end{array}$ \nThis example uses a dictionary whose default value for an entry is a dictionary (whose default value is int(), i.e., zero).

If d is a dictionary and k is a key, we type d[k] and immediately obtain the value. Finding a key given a value is slower and more cumbersome: \n>>> counts $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.defaultdict(int)   \n>>> for word in nltk.corpus.gutenberg.words('milton-paradise.txt'): counts[word] $scriptstyle + =  1$   \n>>> [key for (key, value) in counts.items() if value $scriptstyle = = 3 2$ ]   \n['brought', 'Him', 'virtue', 'Against', 'There', 'thine', 'King', 'mortal',   \n'every', 'been'] \nIf we expect to do this kind of “reverse lookup” often, it helps to construct a dictionary that maps values to keys. In the case that no two keys have the same value, this is an easy thing to do. We just get all the key-value pairs in the dictionary, and create a new dictionary of value-key pairs. The next example also illustrates another way of initializing a dictionary pos with key-value pairs. \n>>> pos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ {'colorless': 'ADJ', 'ideas': 'N', 'sleep': 'V', 'furiously': 'ADV'}   \n>>> pos2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ dict((value, key) for (key, value) in pos.items())   \n>>> pos2['N']   \n'ideas' \nLet’s first make our part-of-speech dictionary a bit more realistic and add some more words to pos using the dictionary update() method, to create the situation where multiple keys have the same value. Then the technique just shown for reverse lookup will no longer work (why not?). Instead, we have to use append() to accumulate the words for each part-of-speech, as follows: \n>>> pos.update({'cats': 'N', 'scratch': 'V', 'peacefully': 'ADV', 'old': 'ADJ'})   \n>>> pos2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.defaultdict(list)   \n>>> for key, value in pos.items(): pos2[value].append(key)   \n>>> pos2['ADV']   \n['peacefully', 'furiously'] \nNow we have inverted the pos dictionary, and can look up any part-of-speech and find all words having that part-of-speech. We can do the same thing even more simply using NLTK’s support for indexing, as follows: \n>>> pos2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.Index((value, key) for (key, value) in pos.items())   \n>>> pos2['ADV']   \n['peacefully', 'furiously'] \nA summary of Python’s dictionary methods is given in Table 5-5.",

We can do the same thing even more simply using NLTK’s support for indexing, as follows: \n>>> pos2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.Index((value, key) for (key, value) in pos.items())   \n>>> pos2['ADV']   \n['peacefully', 'furiously'] \nA summary of Python’s dictionary methods is given in Table 5-5. \n5.4  Automatic Tagging \nIn the rest of this chapter we will explore various ways to automatically add part-ofspeech tags to text. We will see that the tag of a word depends on the word and its context within a sentence. For this reason, we will be working with data at the level of (tagged) sentences rather than words. We’ll begin by loading the data we will be using. \n>>> from nltk.corpus import brown >>> brown_tagged_sents $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown.tagged_sents(categories $ O =$ 'news') >>> brown_sents $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown.sents(categories $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ 'news') \nThe Default Tagger \nThe simplest possible tagger assigns the same tag to each token. This may seem to be a rather banal step, but it establishes an important baseline for tagger performance. In order to get the best result, we tag each word with the most likely tag. Let’s find out which tag is most likely (now using the unsimplified tagset): \n>>> tags $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [tag for (word, tag) in brown.tagged_words(categories $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'news')]   \n>>> nltk.FreqDist(tags).max()   \n'NN' \nNow we can create a tagger that tags everything as NN. \n>>> raw $mathbf { Omega } = mathbf { Omega } ^ { cdot } mathbb { I }$ do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am!'   \n>>> tokens $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.word_tokenize(raw)   \n>>> default_tagger $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.DefaultTagger('NN')   \n>>> default_tagger.tag(tokens)   \n[('I', 'NN'), ('do', 'NN'), ('not', 'NN'), ('like', 'NN'), ('green', 'NN'),   \n('eggs', 'NN'), ('and', 'NN'), ('ham', 'NN'), (',', 'NN'), ('I', 'NN'),",

In the case of tagging, we consider only the current token, in isolation from any larger context. Given such a model, the best we can do is tag each word with its a priori most likely tag. This means we would tag a word such as wind with the same tag, regardless of whether it appears in the context the wind or to wind. \nAn n-gram tagger is a generalization of a unigram tagger whose context is the current word together with the part-of-speech tags of the n-1 preceding tokens, as shown in Figure 5-5. The tag to be chosen, $t _ { n }$ , is circled, and the context is shaded in grey. In the example of an n-gram tagger shown in Figure 5-5, we have $scriptstyle n = 3$ ; that is, we consider the tags of the two preceding words in addition to the current word. An n-gram tagger picks the tag that is most likely in the given context.",

A tagger that simply memorized its training data and made no attempt to construct a general model would get a perfect score, but would be useless for tagging new text.

In the case of tagging, we consider only the current token, in isolation from any larger context. Given such a model, the best we can do is tag each word with its a priori most likely tag. This means we would tag a word such as wind with the same tag, regardless of whether it appears in the context the wind or to wind. \nAn n-gram tagger is a generalization of a unigram tagger whose context is the current word together with the part-of-speech tags of the n-1 preceding tokens, as shown in Figure 5-5. The tag to be chosen, $t _ { n }$ , is circled, and the context is shaded in grey. In the example of an n-gram tagger shown in Figure 5-5, we have $scriptstyle n = 3$ ; that is, we consider the tags of the two preceding words in addition to the current word. An n-gram tagger picks the tag that is most likely in the given context. \n\nA 1-gram tagger is another term for a unigram tagger: i.e., the context used to tag a token is just the text of the token itself. 2-gram taggers are also called bigram taggers, and 3-gram taggers are called trigram taggers. \nThe NgramTagger class uses a tagged training corpus to determine which part-of-speech tag is most likely for each context. Here we see a special case of an n-gram tagger, namely a bigram tagger. First we train it, then use it to tag untagged sentences: \n>>> bigram_tagger $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.BigramTagger(train_sents)   \n>>> bigram_tagger.tag(brown_sents[2007])   \n[('Various', 'JJ'), ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('apartments', 'NNS'),   \n('are', 'BER'), ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('terrace', 'NN'),   \n('type', 'NN'), (', ,'), ('being', 'BEG'), ('on', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'),   \n('ground', 'NN'), ('floor', 'NN'), ('so', 'CS'), ('that', 'CS'),   \n('entrance', 'NN'), ('is', 'BEZ'), ('direct', 'JJ'), ('.', '.')]   \n>>> unseen_sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown_sents[4203]   \n>>> bigram_tagger.tag(unseen_sent)   \n[('The', 'AT'), ('population', 'NN'), ('of', 'IN'), ('the', 'AT'), ('Congo', 'NP'),   \n('is', 'BEZ'), ('13.5', None), ('million', None), (',', None), ('divided', None),   \n('into', None), ('at', None), ('least', None), ('seven', None), ('major', None),   \n('``', None), ('culture', None), ('clusters', None), (\"''\", None), ('and', None),   \n('innumerable', None), ('tribes', None), ('speaking', None), ('400', None),   \n('separate', None), ('dialects', None), ('.', None)] \nNotice that the bigram tagger manages to tag every word in a sentence it saw during training, but does badly on an unseen sentence. As soon as it encounters a new word (i.e., 13.5), it is unable to assign a tag. It cannot tag the following word (i.e., million), even if it was seen during training, simply because it never saw it during training with a None tag on the previous word. Consequently, the tagger fails to tag the rest of the sentence. Its overall accuracy score is very low: \n>>> bigram_tagger.evaluate(test_sents) 0.10276088906608193 \nAs $n$ gets larger, the specificity of the contexts increases, as does the chance that the data we wish to tag contains contexts that were not present in the training data. This is known as the sparse data problem, and is quite pervasive in NLP. As a consequence, there is a trade-off between the accuracy and the coverage of our results (and this is related to the precision/recall trade-off in information retrieval). \nCaution! \nN-gram taggers should not consider context that crosses a sentence boundary. Accordingly, NLTK taggers are designed to work with lists of sentences, where each sentence is a list of words. At the start of a sentence, $t _ { n - 1 }$ and preceding tags are set to None. \nCombining Taggers \nOne way to address the trade-off between accuracy and coverage is to use the more accurate algorithms when we can, but to fall back on algorithms with wider coverage when necessary. For example, we could combine the results of a bigram tagger, a unigram tagger, and a default tagger, as follows: \n1. Try tagging the token with the bigram tagger.   \n2. If the bigram tagger is unable to find a tag for the token, try the unigram tagger.   \n3. If the unigram tagger is also unable to find a tag, use a default tagger. \nMost NLTK taggers permit a backoff tagger to be specified. The backoff tagger may itself have a backoff tagger: \n>>> t0 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.DefaultTagger('NN')   \n>>> t1 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.UnigramTagger(train_sents, backoff=t0)   \n>>> t2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.BigramTagger(train_sents, backoff $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathtt { t } 1$ )   \n>>> t2.evaluate(test_sents)   \n0.84491179108940495 \nYour Turn: Extend the preceding example by defining a TrigramTag ger called t3, which backs off to t2. \nNote that we specify the backoff tagger when the tagger is initialized so that training can take advantage of the backoff tagger. Thus, if the bigram tagger would assign the same tag as its unigram backoff tagger in a certain context, the bigram tagger discards the training instance. This keeps the bigram tagger model as small as possible. We can further specify that a tagger needs to see more than one instance of a context in order to retain it. For example, nltk.BigramTagger(sents, cutoff $scriptstyle : = 2$ , backoff $therefore tan$ ) will discard contexts that have only been seen once or twice.",

How can we do better with these unknown words, or out-of-vocabulary items? \nA useful method to tag unknown words based on context is to limit the vocabulary of a tagger to the most frequent n words, and to replace every other word with a special word UNK using the method shown in Section 5.3. During training, a unigram tagger will probably learn that UNK is usually a noun. However, the n-gram taggers will detect contexts in which it has some other tag. For example, if the preceding word is to (tagged TO), then UNK will probably be tagged as a verb. \nStoring Taggers \nTraining a tagger on a large corpus may take a significant time.

Consider the case of a trigram tagger. How many cases of part-of-speech ambiguity does it encounter? We can determine the answer to this question empirically: \n>>> cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist( ((x[1], y[1], z[0]), z[1]) for sent in brown_tagged_sents for x, y, z in nltk.trigrams(sent))   \n>>> ambiguous_contexts $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [c for c in cfd.conditions() if len(cfd[c]) > 1]   \n>>> sum(cfd[c].N() for c in ambiguous_contexts) / cfd.N()   \n0.049297702068029296 \nThus, 1 out of 20 trigrams is ambiguous. Given the current word and the previous two tags, in $5 %$ of cases there is more than one tag that could be legitimately assigned to the current word according to the training data. Assuming we always pick the most likely tag in such ambiguous contexts, we can derive a lower bound on the performance of a trigram tagger. \nAnother way to investigate the performance of a tagger is to study its mistakes. Some tags may be harder than others to assign, and it might be possible to treat them specially by pre- or post-processing the data. A convenient way to look at tagging errors is the confusion matrix. It charts expected tags (the gold standard) against actual tags generated by a tagger: \n>>> test_tags $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [tag for sent in brown.sents(categories $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ 'editorial') for (word, tag) in t2.tag(sent)]   \n>>> gold_tags $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [tag for (word, tag) in brown.tagged_words(categories $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'editorial')]   \n>>> print nltk.ConfusionMatrix(gold, test) \nBased on such analysis we may decide to modify the tagset. Perhaps a distinction between tags that is difficult to make can be dropped, since it is not important in the context of some larger processing task. \nAnother way to analyze the performance bound on a tagger comes from the less than $100 %$ agreement between human annotators. \nIn general, observe that the tagging process collapses distinctions: e.g., lexical identity is usually lost when all personal pronouns are tagged PRP. At the same time, the tagging process introduces new distinctions and removes ambiguities: e.g., deal tagged as VB or NN. This characteristic of collapsing certain distinctions and introducing new distinctions is an important feature of tagging which facilitates classification and prediction. When we introduce finer distinctions in a tagset, an n-gram tagger gets more detailed information about the left-context when it is deciding what tag to assign to a particular word. However, the tagger simultaneously has to do more work to classify the current token, simply because there are more tags to choose from. Conversely, with fewer distinctions (as with the simplified tagset), the tagger has less information about context, and it has a smaller range of choices in classifying the current token. \nWe have seen that ambiguity in the training data leads to an upper limit in tagger performance. Sometimes more context will resolve the ambiguity. In other cases, however, as noted by (Abney, 1996), the ambiguity can be resolved only with reference to syntax or to world knowledge. Despite these imperfections, part-of-speech tagging has played a central role in the rise of statistical approaches to natural language processing. In the early 1990s, the surprising accuracy of statistical taggers was a striking demonstration that it was possible to solve one small part of the language understanding problem, namely part-of-speech disambiguation, without reference to deeper sources of linguistic knowledge. Can this idea be pushed further? In Chapter 7, we will see that it can. \n\nTagging Across Sentence Boundaries \nAn n-gram tagger uses recent tags to guide the choice of tag for the current word. When tagging the first word of a sentence, a trigram tagger will be using the part-of-speech tag of the previous two tokens, which will normally be the last word of the previous sentence and the sentence-ending punctuation. However, the lexical category that closed the previous sentence has no bearing on the one that begins the next sentence. \nTo deal with this situation, we can train, run, and evaluate taggers using lists of tagged sentences, as shown in Example 5-5. \nExample 5-5. $N$ -gram tagging at the sentence level. \nbrown_tagged_sents $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown.tagged_sents(categories $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ 'news') brown_sents $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown.sents(categories $mathbf { Psi } = mathbf { Psi }$ 'news') \nsize $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ int(len(brown_tagged_sents) * 0.9) train_sents $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ brown_tagged_sents[:size] test_sents $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ brown_tagged_sents[size:] \n$dag 0 = dag$ nltk.DefaultTagger('NN') t1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.UnigramTagger(train_sents, backoff $therefore angle B$ ) $ t 2  =$ nltk.BigramTagger(train_sents, backoff $scriptstyle mathtt { dot { Lambda } } = mathtt { t } 1$ ) \n>>> t2.evaluate(test_sents) 0.84491179108940495 \n5.6  Transformation-Based Tagging \nA potential issue with n-gram taggers is the size of their n-gram table (or language model).

The only information an n-gram tagger considers from prior context is tags, even though words themselves might be a useful source of information. It is simply impractical for n-gram models to be conditioned on the identities of words in the context. In this section, we examine Brill tagging, an inductive tagging method which performs very well using models that are only a tiny fraction of the size of n-gram taggers. \nBrill tagging is a kind of transformation-based learning, named after its inventor. The general idea is very simple: guess the tag of each word, then go back and fix the mistakes. \nIn this way, a Brill tagger successively transforms a bad tagging of a text into a better one. As with n-gram tagging, this is a supervised learning method, since we need annotated training data to figure out whether the tagger’s guess is a mistake or not. However, unlike n-gram tagging, it does not count observations but compiles a list of transformational correction rules. \nThe process of Brill tagging is usually explained by analogy with painting. Suppose we were painting a tree, with all its details of boughs, branches, twigs, and leaves, against a uniform sky-blue background. Instead of painting the tree first and then trying to paint blue in the gaps, it is simpler to paint the whole canvas blue, then “correct” the tree section by over-painting the blue background. In the same fashion, we might paint the trunk a uniform brown before going back to over-paint further details with even finer brushes. Brill tagging uses the same idea: begin with broad brush strokes, and then fix up the details, with successively finer changes. Let’s look at an example involving the following sentence: \n(1) The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation. \nWe will examine the operation of two rules: (a) replace NN with VB when the previous word is TO; (b) replace TO with IN when the next tag is NNS. Table 5-6 illustrates this process, first tagging with the unigram tagger, then applying the rules to fix the errors. \nIn this table, we see two rules. All such rules are generated from a template of the following form: “replace $T _ { 1 }$ with $T _ { 2 }$ in the context C.” Typical contexts are the identity or the tag of the preceding or following word, or the appearance of a specific tag within two to three words of the current word. During its training phase, the tagger guesses values for $T _ { 1 }$ , $T _ { 2 }$ , and C, to create thousands of candidate rules. Each rule is scored according to its net benefit: the number of incorrect tags that it corrects, less the number of correct tags it incorrectly modifies. \nBrill taggers have another interesting property: the rules are linguistically interpretable. Compare this with the n-gram taggers, which employ a potentially massive table of ngrams. We cannot learn much from direct inspection of such a table, in comparison to the rules learned by the Brill tagger. Example 5-6 demonstrates NLTK’s Brill tagger. \nExample 5-6. Brill tagger demonstration: The tagger has a collection of templates of the form $X  Y$ if the preceding word is Z; the variables in these templates are instantiated to particular words and tags to create “rules”; the score for a rule is the number of broken examples it corrects minus the number of correct cases it breaks; apart from training a tagger, the demonstration displays residual errors. \n>>> nltk.tag.brill.demo() Training Brill tagger on 80 sentences. Finding initial useful rules.. Found 6555 useful rules. \n5.7  How to Determine the Category of a Word \nNow that we have examined word classes in detail, we turn to a more basic question: how do we decide what category a word belongs to in the first place? In general, linguists use morphological, syntactic, and semantic clues to determine the category of a word.",

        "content": "Morphological Clues \nThe internal structure of a word may give useful clues as to the word’s category. For example, -ness is a suffix that combines with an adjective to produce a noun, e.g., happy $mid  mid$ happiness, $i l l $ illness. So if we encounter a word that ends in -ness, this is very likely to be a noun. Similarly, -ment is a suffix that combines with some verbs to produce a noun, e.g., govern $$ government and establish $$ establishment. \nEnglish verbs can also be morphologically complex. For instance, the present participle of a verb ends in -ing, and expresses the idea of ongoing, incomplete action (e.g., falling, eating). The -ing suffix also appears on nouns derived from verbs, e.g., the falling of the leaves (this is known as the gerund). \nSyntactic Clues \nAnother source of information is the typical contexts in which a word can occur. For example, assume that we have already determined the category of nouns. Then we might say that a syntactic criterion for an adjective in English is that it can occur immediately before a noun, or immediately following the words be or very. According to these tests, near should be categorized as an adjective: \n(2) a. the near window b. The end is (very) near. \nSemantic Clues \nFinally, the meaning of a word is a useful clue as to its lexical category. For example, the best-known definition of a noun is semantic: “the name of a person, place, or thing.” Within modern linguistics, semantic criteria for word classes are treated with suspicion, mainly because they are hard to formalize. Nevertheless, semantic criteria underpin many of our intuitions about word classes, and enable us to make a good guess about the categorization of words in languages with which we are unfamiliar. For example, if all we know about the Dutch word verjaardag is that it means the same as the English word birthday, then we can guess that verjaardag is a noun in Dutch. However, some care is needed: although we might translate zij is vandaag jarig as it’s her birthday today, the word jarig is in fact an adjective in Dutch, and has no exact equivalent in English. \nNew Words \nAll languages acquire new lexical items. A list of words recently added to the Oxford Dictionary of English includes cyberslacker, fatoush, blamestorm, SARS, cantopop, bupkis, noughties, muggle, and robata. Notice that all these new words are nouns, and this is reflected in calling nouns an open class. By contrast, prepositions are regarded as a closed class. That is, there is a limited set of words belonging to the class (e.g., above, along, at, below, beside, between, during, for, from, in, near, on, outside, over, past, through, towards, under, up, with), and membership of the set only changes very gradually over time.",

For example, is might be tagged simply as a verb in one tagset, but as a distinct form of the lexeme be in another tagset (as in the Brown Corpus). This variation in tagsets is unavoidable, since part-of-speech tags are used in different ways for different tasks. In other words, there is no one “right way” to assign tags, only more or less useful ways depending on one’s goals. \n5.8  Summary \nWords can be grouped into classes, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. These classes are known as lexical categories or parts-of-speech. Parts-of-speech are assigned short labels, or tags, such as NN and VB.   \n• The process of automatically assigning parts-of-speech to words in text is called part-of-speech tagging, POS tagging, or just tagging.   \n• Automatic tagging is an important step in the NLP pipeline, and is useful in a variety of situations, including predicting the behavior of previously unseen words, analyzing word usage in corpora, and text-to-speech systems.   \n• Some linguistic corpora, such as the Brown Corpus, have been POS tagged.   \n• A variety of tagging methods are possible, e.g., default tagger, regular expression tagger, unigram tagger, and n-gram taggers. These can be combined using a technique known as backoff.   \n• Taggers can be trained and evaluated using tagged corpora.   \n• Backoff is a method for combining models: when a more specialized model (such as a bigram tagger) cannot assign a tag in a given context, we back off to a more general model (such as a unigram tagger).   \n• Part-of-speech tagging is an important, early example of a sequence classification task in NLP: a classification decision at any one point in the sequence makes use of words and tags in the local context.   \n• A dictionary is used to map between arbitrary types of information, such as a string and a number: freq['cat'] = 12. We create dictionaries using the brace notation: $mathsf { p o s }  =  { } , mathsf { p o s }  =  { mathrm { ' f u r i o u s l y \" : }  mathrm { ` a d v \" } quad $ , 'ideas': 'n', 'colorless': 'adj'}. N-gram taggers can be defined for large values of $n$ , but once $n$ is larger than 3, we usually encounter the sparse data problem; even with a large quantity of training data, we see only a tiny fraction of possible contexts.",

Parts-of-speech are assigned short labels, or tags, such as NN and VB.   \n• The process of automatically assigning parts-of-speech to words in text is called part-of-speech tagging, POS tagging, or just tagging.   \n• Automatic tagging is an important step in the NLP pipeline, and is useful in a variety of situations, including predicting the behavior of previously unseen words, analyzing word usage in corpora, and text-to-speech systems.   \n• Some linguistic corpora, such as the Brown Corpus, have been POS tagged.   \n• A variety of tagging methods are possible, e.g., default tagger, regular expression tagger, unigram tagger, and n-gram taggers. These can be combined using a technique known as backoff.   \n• Taggers can be trained and evaluated using tagged corpora.   \n• Backoff is a method for combining models: when a more specialized model (such as a bigram tagger) cannot assign a tag in a given context, we back off to a more general model (such as a unigram tagger).   \n• Part-of-speech tagging is an important, early example of a sequence classification task in NLP: a classification decision at any one point in the sequence makes use of words and tags in the local context.   \n• A dictionary is used to map between arbitrary types of information, such as a string and a number: freq['cat'] = 12. We create dictionaries using the brace notation: $mathsf { p o s }  =  { } , mathsf { p o s }  =  { mathrm { ' f u r i o u s l y \" : }  mathrm { ` a d v \" } quad $ , 'ideas': 'n', 'colorless': 'adj'}. N-gram taggers can be defined for large values of $n$ , but once $n$ is larger than 3, we usually encounter the sparse data problem; even with a large quantity of training data, we see only a tiny fraction of possible contexts. \n• Transformation-based tagging involves learning a series of repair rules of the form “change tag s to tag $t$ in context $c$ ,” where each rule fixes mistakes and possibly introduces a (smaller) number of errors. \n5.9  Further Reading \nExtra materials for this chapter are posted at http://www.nltk.org/, including links to freely available resources on the Web. For more examples of tagging with NLTK, please see the Tagging HOWTO at http://www.nltk.org/howto. Chapters 4 and 5 of (Jurafsky & Martin, 2008) contain more advanced material on n-grams and part-of-speech tagging. Other approaches to tagging involve machine learning methods (Chapter 6). In Chapter 7, we will see a generalization of tagging called chunking in which a contiguous sequence of words is assigned a single tag. \nFor tagset documentation, see nltk.help.upenn_tagset() and nltk.help.brown_tag set(). Lexical categories are introduced in linguistics textbooks, including those listed in Chapter 1 of this book. \nThere are many other kinds of tagging. Words can be tagged with directives to a speech synthesizer, indicating which words should be emphasized. Words can be tagged with sense numbers, indicating which sense of the word was used. Words can also be tagged with morphological features. Examples of each of these kinds of tags are shown in the following list. For space reasons, we only show the tag for a single word. Note also that the first two examples use XML-style tags, where elements in angle brackets enclose the word that is tagged. \nSpeech Synthesis Markup Language (W3C SSML) \nThat is a <emphasis>big</emphasis> car! \nSemCor: Brown Corpus tagged with WordNet senses Space in any <wf pos $ c =$ \"NN\" lemma $ c =$ \"form\" wnsn $ c =$ \"4\">form</wf> is completely meas ured by the three dimensions.

Which nouns are more common in their plural form, rather than their singular form? (Only consider regular plurals, formed with the -s suffix.) b. Which word has the greatest number of distinct tags? What are they, and what do they represent? c. List tags in order of decreasing frequency. What do the 20 most frequent tags represent? d. Which tags are nouns most commonly found after? What do these tags represent? \n16. ◑ Explore the following issues that arise in connection with the lookup tagger: \na. What happens to the tagger performance for the various model sizes when a backoff tagger is omitted?   \nb. Consider the curve in Figure 5-4; suggest a good size for a lookup tagger that balances memory and performance. Can you come up with scenarios where it would be preferable to minimize memory usage, or to maximize performance with no regard for memory usage? \n17. ◑ What is the upper limit of performance for a lookup tagger, assuming no limit to the size of its table? (Hint: write a program to work out what percentage of tokens of a word are assigned the most likely tag for that word, on average.) \n18. ◑ Generate some statistics for tagged data to answer the following questions: \na. What proportion of word types are always assigned the same part-of-speech tag?   \nb. How many words are ambiguous, in the sense that they appear with at least two tags?   \nc. What percentage of word tokens in the Brown Corpus involve these ambiguous words? \n19. ◑ The evaluate() method works out how accurately the tagger performs on this text. For example, if the supplied tagged text was [('the', 'DT'), ('dog', 'NN')] and the tagger produced the output [('the', 'NN'), $( ^ { prime } mathsf { d o g ^ { prime } } , mathsf { Lambda ^ { prime } N N ^ { prime } } ) ]$ , then the score would be 0.5. Let’s try to figure out how the evaluation method works: \na. A tagger t takes a list of words as input, and produces a list of tagged words as output. However, t.evaluate() is given correctly tagged text as its only parameter. What must it do with this input before performing the tagging? \nb. Once the tagger has created newly tagged text, how might the evaluate() method go about comparing it with the original tagged text and computing the accuracy score?   \nc. Now examine the source code to see how the method is implemented. Inspect nltk.tag.api.__file__ to discover the location of the source code, and open this file using an editor (be sure to use the api.py file and not the compiled api.pyc binary file). \n20. ◑ Write code to search the Brown Corpus for particular words and phrases according to tags, to answer the following questions: \na. Produce an alphabetically sorted list of the distinct words tagged as MD.   \nb. Identify words that can be plural nouns or third person singular verbs (e.g., deals, flies).   \nc. Identify three-word prepositional phrases of the form $mathrm { I N } + mathrm { D E T } + mathrm { N N }$ (e.g., in the lab).   \nd. What is the ratio of masculine to feminine pronouns?   \n21. ◑ In Table 3-1, we saw a table involving frequency counts for the verbs adore, love, like, and prefer, and preceding qualifiers such as really. Investigate the full range of qualifiers (Brown tag QL) that appear before these four verbs.   \n22. ◑ We defined the regexp_tagger that can be used as a fall-back tagger for unknown words. This tagger only checks for cardinal numbers. By testing for particular prefix or suffix strings, it should be possible to guess other tags. For example, we could tag any word that ends with -s as a plural noun. Define a regular expression tagger (using RegexpTagger()) that tests for at least five other patterns in the spelling of words. (Use inline documentation to explain the rules.)   \n23. $mathbf { 0 }$ Consider the regular expression tagger developed in the exercises in the previous section. Evaluate the tagger using its accuracy() method, and try to come up with ways to improve its performance. Discuss your findings. How does objective evaluation help in the development process?   \n24. $mathbf { 0 }$ How serious is the sparse data problem? Investigate the performance of n-gram taggers as $n$ increases from 1 to 6. Tabulate the accuracy score. Estimate the training data required for these taggers, assuming a vocabulary size of $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ and a tagset size of $1 0 ^ { 2 }$ .   \n25. $mathbf { 0 }$ Obtain some tagged data for another language, and train and evaluate a variety of taggers on it. If the language is morphologically complex, or if there are any orthographic clues (e.g., capitalization) to word classes, consider developing a regular expression tagger for it (ordered after the unigram tagger, and before the default tagger). How does the accuracy of your tagger(s) compare with the same taggers run on English data? Discuss any issues you encounter in applying these methods to the language. \n\n26. ◑ Example 5-4 plotted a curve showing change in the performance of a lookup tagger as the model size was increased. Plot the performance curve for a unigram tagger, as the amount of training data is varied. \n27. ◑ Inspect the confusion matrix for the bigram tagger t2 defined in Section 5.5, and identify one or more sets of tags to collapse. Define a dictionary to do the mapping, and evaluate the tagger on the simplified data.   \n28. $mathbf { 0 }$ Experiment with taggers using the simplified tagset (or make one of your own by discarding all but the first character of each tag name). Such a tagger has fewer distinctions to make, but much less information on which to base its work. Discuss your findings.   \n29. ◑ Recall the example of a bigram tagger which encountered a word it hadn’t seen during training, and tagged the rest of the sentence as None. It is possible for a bigram tagger to fail partway through a sentence even if it contains no unseen words (even if the sentence was used during training). In what circumstance can this happen? Can you write a program to find some examples of this?   \n30. ◑ Preprocess the Brown News data by replacing low-frequency words with UNK, but leaving the tags untouched. Now train and evaluate a bigram tagger on this data. How much does this help? What is the contribution of the unigram tagger and default tagger now?   \n31. ◑ Modify the program in Example 5-4 to use a logarithmic scale on the $x$ -axis, by replacing pylab.plot() with pylab.semilogx(). What do you notice about the shape of the resulting plot? Does the gradient tell you anything?   \n32. ◑ Consult the documentation for the Brill tagger demo function, using help(nltk.tag.brill.demo). Experiment with the tagger by setting different values for the parameters. Is there any trade-off between training time (corpus size) and performance?   \n33. $mathbf { 0 }$ Write code that builds a dictionary of dictionaries of sets. Use it to store the set of POS tags that can follow a given word having a given POS tag, i.e., $mathrm { w o r d } _ { i }  mathrm { t a g } _ { i } $ tagi+1.   \n34. $bullet$ There are 264 distinct words in the Brown Corpus having exactly three possible tags. a. Print a table with the integers 1..10 in one column, and the number of distinct words in the corpus having 1..10 distinct tags in the other column. b. For the word with the greatest number of distinct tags, print out sentences from the corpus containing the word, one for each possible tag.   \n35. ● Write a program to classify contexts involving the word must according to the tag of the following word. Can this be used to discriminate between the epistemic and deontic uses of must?   \n36. $bullet$ Create a regular expression tagger and various unigram and n-gram taggers, \nincorporating backoff, and train them on part of the Brown Corpus. \na. Create three different combinations of the taggers. Test the accuracy of each combined tagger. Which combination works best? b. Try varying the size of the training corpus. How does it affect your results? \n37. $bullet$ Our approach for tagging an unknown word has been to consider the letters of the word (using RegexpTagger()), or to ignore the word altogether and tag it as a noun (using nltk.DefaultTagger()). These methods will not do well for texts having new words that are not nouns. Consider the sentence I like to blog on Kim’s blog. If blog is a new word, then looking at the previous tag (TO versus $N P  S$ ) would probably be helpful, i.e., we need a default tagger that is sensitive to the preceding tag. a. Create a new kind of unigram tagger that looks at the tag of the previous word, and ignores the current word. (The best way to do this is to modify the source code for UnigramTagger(), which presumes knowledge of object-oriented programming in Python.) b. Add this tagger to the sequence of backoff taggers (including ordinary trigram and bigram taggers that look at words), right before the usual default tagger. c. Evaluate the contribution of this new unigram tagger. \n38. $bullet$ Consider the code in Section 5.5, which determines the upper bound for accuracy of a trigram tagger. Review Abney’s discussion concerning the impossibility of exact tagging (Abney, 2006). Explain why correct tagging of these examples requires access to other kinds of information than just words and tags. How might you estimate the scale of this problem?   \n39. ● Use some of the estimation techniques in nltk.probability, such as Lidstone or Laplace estimation, to develop a statistical tagger that does a better job than ngram backoff taggers in cases where contexts encountered during testing were not seen during training.   \n40. ● Inspect the diagnostic files created by the Brill tagger rules.out and errors.out. Obtain the demonstration code by accessing the source code (at http: //www.nltk.org/code) and create your own version of the Brill tagger. Delete some of the rule templates, based on what you learned from inspecting rules.out. Add some new rule templates which employ contexts that might help to correct the errors you saw in errors.out.   \n41. $bullet$ Develop an n-gram backoff tagger that permits “anti-n-grams” such as [\"the\", \"the\"] to be specified when a tagger is initialized. An anti-n-gram is assigned a count of zero and is used to prevent backoff for this n-gram (e.g., to avoid estimating $mathrm { P } ( t h e mid t h e )$ as just $mathrm { P } ( t h e ) ,$ ).   \n42. $bullet$ Investigate three different ways to define the split between training and testing data when developing a tagger using the Brown Corpus: genre (category), source (fileid), and sentence. Compare their relative performance and discuss which method is the most legitimate. (You might use n-fold cross validation, discussed in Section 6.3, to improve the accuracy of the evaluations.) \nLearning to Classify Text \nDetecting patterns is a central part of Natural Language Processing. Words ending in -ed tend to be past tense verbs (Chapter 5). Frequent use of will is indicative of news text (Chapter 3). These observable patterns—word structure and word frequency— happen to correlate with particular aspects of meaning, such as tense and topic. But how did we know where to start looking, which aspects of form to associate with which aspects of meaning? \nThe goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions: \n1. How can we identify particular features of language data that are salient for classifying it?   \n2. How can we construct models of language that can be used to perform language processing tasks automatically?   \n3. What can we learn about language from these models? \nAlong the way we will study some important machine learning techniques, including decision trees, naive Bayes classifiers, and maximum entropy classifiers. We will gloss over the mathematical and statistical underpinnings of these techniques, focusing instead on how and when to use them (see Section 6.9 for more technical background). Before looking at these methods, we first need to appreciate the broad scope of this topic. \n6.1  Supervised Classification \nClassification is the task of choosing the correct class label for a given input. In basic classification tasks, each input is considered in isolation from all other inputs, and the set of labels is defined in advance. Some examples of classification tasks are:",

For example, in multiclass classification, each instance may be assigned multiple labels; in open-class classification, the set of labels is not defined in advance; and in sequence classification, a list of inputs are jointly classified. \nA classifier is called supervised if it is built based on training corpora containing the correct label for each input. The framework used by supervised classification is shown in Figure 6-1. \nIn the rest of this section, we will look at how classifiers can be employed to solve a wide variety of tasks. Our discussion is not intended to be comprehensive, but to give a representative sample of tasks that can be performed with the help of text classifiers. \nGender Identification \nIn Section 2.4, we saw that male and female names have some distinctive characteristics. Names ending in a, $e$ , and $i$ are likely to be female, while names ending in ${ boldsymbol { k } } , { boldsymbol { o } } , { boldsymbol { r } } , { boldsymbol { s } }$ , and $t$ are likely to be male. Let’s build a classifier to model these differences more precisely. \nThe first step in creating a classifier is deciding what features of the input are relevant, and how to encode those features. For this example, we’ll start by just looking at the final letter of a given name. The following feature extractor function builds a dictionary containing relevant information about a given name: \n>>> def gender_features(word): return {'last_letter': word[-1]} >>> gender_features('Shrek') {'last_letter': 'k'} \nThe dictionary that is returned by this function is called a feature set and maps from features’ names to their values. Feature names are case-sensitive strings that typically provide a short human-readable description of the feature. Feature values are values with simple types, such as Booleans, numbers, and strings. \nMost classification methods require that features be encoded using simple value types, such as Booleans, numbers, and strings. But note that just because a feature has a simple type, this does not necessarily mean that the feature’s value is simple to express or compute; indeed, it is even possible to use very complex and informative values, such as the output of a second supervised classifier, as features. \nNow that we’ve defined a feature extractor, we need to prepare a list of examples and corresponding class labels: \n>>> from nltk.corpus import names   \n>>> import random   \n>>> names $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ([(name, 'male') for name in names.words('male.txt')] + [(name, 'female') for name in names.words('female.txt')])   \n>>> random.shuffle(names) \nNext, we use the feature extractor to process the names data, and divide the resulting list of feature sets into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train a new “naive Bayes” classifier. \n>>> featuresets $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(gender_features(n), g) for (n,g) in names] >>> train_set, test_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ featuresets[500:], featuresets[:500] >>> classifier $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set) \nWe will learn more about the naive Bayes classifier later in the chapter. For now, let’s just test it out on some names that did not appear in its training data: \n>>> classifier.classify(gender_features('Neo'))   \n'male'   \n>>> classifier.classify(gender_features('Trinity'))   \n'female' \nObserve that these character names from The Matrix are correctly classified. Although this science fiction movie is set in 2199, it still conforms with our expectations about names and genders. We can systematically evaluate the classifier on a much larger quantity of unseen data: \n>>> print nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set) 0.758 \nFinally, we can examine the classifier to determine which features it found most effective for distinguishing the names’ genders: \n>>> classifier.show_most_informative_features(5)   \nMost Informative Features ${ begin{array} { r l } { bot { mathsf { d e v t _ i e r t e r } } } & { = quad mathsf { a } }  { bot { mathsf { a s t _ l e t t e r } } } & { = mathbf { Phi } ^ { star } mathbf { k } ^ { star } }  { bot { mathsf { a s t _ l e t t e r } } } & { = mathbf { Phi } ^ { star } mathbf { f } ^ { star } }  { bot { mathsf { a s t _ l e t t e r } } } & { = mathbf { Phi } ^ { star } mathbf { p } ^ { star } , }  { bot { mathsf { a s t _ l e t t e r } } } & { = mathbf { Phi } ^ { star } mathbf { Phi } _ { mathsf { W } } ^ { star } , } end{array} }$ last_letter $mathbf { omega } = mathbf { dot { omega } } mathbf { a } ^ { prime }$ female : male male : female $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 38.3 : 1.0 31.4 : 1.0 male : female $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 15.3 : 1.0 male : female $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 10.6 : 1.0 male : female $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 10.6 : 1.0 \nThis listing shows that the names in the training set that end in $a$ are female 38 times more often than they are male, but names that end in $k$ are male 31 times more often than they are female.

Much of the interesting work in building a classifier is deciding what features might be relevant, and how we can represent them. Although it’s often possible to get decent performance by using a fairly simple and obvious set of features, there are usually significant gains to be had by using carefully constructed features based on a thorough understanding of the task at hand. \nTypically, feature extractors are built through a process of trial-and-error, guided by intuitions about what information is relevant to the problem. It’s common to start with a “kitchen sink” approach, including all the features that you can think of, and then checking to see which features actually are helpful. We take this approach for name gender features in Example 6-1. \nExample 6-1. A feature extractor that overfits gender features. The featuresets returned by this feature extractor contain a large number of specific features, leading to overfitting for the relatively small Names Corpus. \ndef gender_features2(name): features $= { }$ features[\"firstletter\"] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ name[0].lower() features[\"lastletter\"] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ name[–1].lower() for letter in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz': features[\"count(%s)\" % letter] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ name.lower().count(letter) features[\"has(%s)\" % letter] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ (letter in name.lower()) return features \nHowever, there are usually limits to the number of features that you should use with a given learning algorithm—if you provide too many features, then the algorithm will have a higher chance of relying on idiosyncrasies of your training data that don’t generalize well to new examples. This problem is known as overfitting, and can be especially problematic when working with small training sets. For example, if we train a naive Bayes classifier using the feature extractor shown in Example 6-1, it will overfit the relatively small training set, resulting in a system whose accuracy is about $1 %$ lower than the accuracy of a classifier that only pays attention to the final letter of each name: \n>>> featuresets $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(gender_features2(n), g) for (n,g) in names] >>> train_set, test_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ featuresets[500:], featuresets[:500] >>> classifier $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set) >>> print nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set) 0.748 \nOnce an initial set of features has been chosen, a very productive method for refining the feature set is error analysis. First, we select a development set, containing the corpus data for creating the model. This development set is then subdivided into the training set and the dev-test set. \n>>> train_names $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ names[1500:] >>> devtest_names $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ names[500:1500] >>> test_names $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ names[:500] \nThe training set is used to train the model, and the dev-test set is used to perform error analysis. The test set serves in our final evaluation of the system. For reasons discussed later, it is important that we employ a separate dev-test set for error analysis, rather than just using the test set. The division of the corpus data into different subsets is shown in Figure 6-2. \nHaving divided the corpus into appropriate datasets, we train a model using the training set $bullet$ , and then run it on the dev-test set $pmb { theta }$ . \n>>> train_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(gender_features(n), g) for $( mathsf { n } , mathsf { g } )$ in train_names] $gg >$ devtest_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(gender_features(n), g) for $( mathsf { n } , mathsf { g } )$ in devtest_names] >>> test_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(gender_features(n), g) for $( mathsf { n } , mathsf { g } )$ in test_names] >>> classifier $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set) \n>>> print nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, devtest_set) 0.765 \nUsing the dev-test set, we can generate a list of the errors that the classifier makes when predicting name genders: \n>>> errors $= [ ]$   \n$gg >$ for (name, tag) in devtest_names: guess $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ classifier.classify(gender_features(name)) if guess $mathbf { ! = }$ tag: errors.append( (tag, guess, name) ) \nWe can then examine individual error cases where the model predicted the wrong label, and try to determine what additional pieces of information would allow it to make the right decision (or which existing pieces of information are tricking it into making the wrong decision). The feature set can then be adjusted accordingly. The names classifier that we have built generates about 100 errors on the dev-test corpus: \n>>> for (tag, guess, name) in sorted(errors): # doctest: +ELLIPSIS +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE print 'correct=%-8s gues $S = % - 8 s$ name $= %$ -30s' %   \n(tag, guess, name)   \ncorrect=female guess $ v { r } _ { 1 } =$ male name $ L _ { ! } =$ Cindelyn   \ncorrect $ c =$ female guess $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ male name=Katheryn   \ncorrect $ c =$ female guess $ c =$ male name $ c =$ Kathryn   \ncorrect=male guess $ v { r } _ { mathbf { lambda } } =$ female name $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ Aldrich   \ncorrect=male guess=female name=Mitch   \ncorrect=male guess $ v { S } _ {  v { r } } =$ female name=Rich \nLooking through this list of errors makes it clear that some suffixes that are more than one letter can be indicative of name genders. For example, names ending in yn appear to be predominantly female, despite the fact that names ending in $n$ tend to be male; and names ending in $c h$ are usually male, even though names that end in $h$ tend to be female. We therefore adjust our feature extractor to include features for two-letter suffixes: \n>>> def gender_features(word): return {'suffix1': word[-1:], 'suffix2': word[-2:]} \nRebuilding the classifier with the new feature extractor, we see that the performance on the dev-test dataset improves by almost three percentage points (from $7 6 . 5 %$ to $7 8 . 2 %$ ): \n>>> train_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(gender_features(n), g) for $( mathsf { n } , mathsf { g } )$ in train_names] >>> devtest_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(gender_features(n), g) for (n,g) in devtest_names] >>> classifier $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set) $gg >$ print nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, devtest_set) 0.782 \nThis error analysis procedure can then be repeated, checking for patterns in the errors that are made by the newly improved classifier. Each time the error analysis procedure is repeated, we should select a different dev-test/training split, to ensure that the classifier does not start to reflect idiosyncrasies in the dev-test set. \nBut once we’ve used the dev-test set to help us develop the model, we can no longer trust that it will give us an accurate idea of how well the model would perform on new data. It is therefore important to keep the test set separate, and unused, until our model development is complete. At that point, we can use the test set to evaluate how well our model will perform on new input values. \nDocument Classification \nIn Section 2.1, we saw several examples of corpora where documents have been labeled with categories. Using these corpora, we can build classifiers that will automatically tag new documents with appropriate category labels. First, we construct a list of documents, labeled with the appropriate categories. For this example, we’ve chosen the Movie Reviews Corpus, which categorizes each review as positive or negative. \n>>> from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews   \n>>> documents $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(list(movie_reviews.words(fileid)), category) for category in movie_reviews.categories() for fileid in movie_reviews.fileids(category)]   \n>>> random.shuffle(documents) \nNext, we define a feature extractor for documents, so the classifier will know which aspects of the data it should pay attention to (see Example 6-2). For document topic identification, we can define a feature for each word, indicating whether the document contains that word. To limit the number of features that the classifier needs to process, we begin by constructing a list of the 2,000 most frequent words in the overall corpus . We can then define a feature extractor $pmb { theta }$ that simply checks whether each of these words is present in a given document.",

To check how reliable the resulting classifier is, we compute its accuracy on the test set $bullet$ . And once again, we can use show_most_infor mative_features() to find out which features the classifier found to be most informative $pmb { theta }$ . \nExample 6-3.

However, this regular expression tagger had to be handcrafted. Instead, we can train a classifier to work out which suffixes are most informative. Let’s begin by finding the most common suffixes: \n>>> from nltk.corpus import brown   \n>>> suffix_fdist $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FreqDist()   \n>>> for word in brown.words(): word $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ word.lower() suffix_fdist.inc(word[-1:]) suffix_fdist.inc(word[-2:]) suffix_fdist.inc(word[-3:])   \n>>> common_suffixes $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ suffix_fdist.keys()[:100]   \n>>> print common_suffixes   \n['e d', 'he', n' a 'of' 'the y o in ed nd' is on g' 1 'and', ng er as ing h at or 're', 'it', an m ion', \nNext, we’ll define a feature extractor function that checks a given word for these suffixes: \n>>> def pos_features(word): features $= { }$ for suffix in common_suffixes: features['endswith(%s)' % suffix] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ word.lower().endswith(suffix) return features \nFeature extraction functions behave like tinted glasses, highlighting some of the properties (colors) in our data and making it impossible to see other properties. The classifier will rely exclusively on these highlighted properties when determining how to label inputs. In this case, the classifier will make its decisions based only on information about which of the common suffixes (if any) a given word has. \nNow that we’ve defined our feature extractor, we can use it to train a new “decision tree” classifier (to be discussed in Section 6.4): \n>>> tagged_words $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ brown.tagged_words(categories $mathbf { sigma } _ { cdot } = mathbf { sigma } _ { cdot }$ 'news')   \n>>> featuresets $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(pos_features(n), g) for (n,g) in tagged_words]   \n>>> size $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ int(len(featuresets) $* _ { 0 . 1 } ,$ ）   \n>>> train_set, test_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ featuresets[size:], featuresets[:size]   \n>>> classifier $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.DecisionTreeClassifier.train(train_set)   \n>>> nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set)   \n0.62705121829935351   \n>>> classifier.classify(pos_features('cats'))   \n'NNS' \nOne nice feature of decision tree models is that they are often fairly easy to interpret.

Next, the classifier checks whether the word ends in \"the\", in which case it’s almost certainly a determiner. This “suffix” gets used early by the decision tree because the word the is so common. Continuing on, the classifier checks if the word ends in s. If so, then it’s most likely to receive the verb tag VBZ (unless it’s the word is, which has the special tag BEZ), and if not, then it’s most likely a noun (unless it’s the punctuation mark “.”). The actual classifier contains further nested if-then statements below the ones shown here, but the depth $scriptstyle = 4$ argument just displays the top portion of the decision tree. \nExploiting Context \nBy augmenting the feature extraction function, we could modify this part-of-speech tagger to leverage a variety of other word-internal features, such as the length of the word, the number of syllables it contains, or its prefix. However, as long as the feature extractor just looks at the target word, we have no way to add features that depend on the context in which the word appears. But contextual features often provide powerful clues about the correct tag—for example, when tagging the word fly, knowing that the previous word is $a$ will allow us to determine that it is functioning as a noun, not a verb. \nIn order to accommodate features that depend on a word’s context, we must revise the pattern that we used to define our feature extractor. Instead of just passing in the word to be tagged, we will pass in a complete (untagged) sentence, along with the index of the target word. This approach is demonstrated in Example 6-4, which employs a context-dependent feature extractor to define a part-of-speech tag classifier.",

Next, the classifier checks whether the word ends in \"the\", in which case it’s almost certainly a determiner. This “suffix” gets used early by the decision tree because the word the is so common. Continuing on, the classifier checks if the word ends in s. If so, then it’s most likely to receive the verb tag VBZ (unless it’s the word is, which has the special tag BEZ), and if not, then it’s most likely a noun (unless it’s the punctuation mark “.”). The actual classifier contains further nested if-then statements below the ones shown here, but the depth $scriptstyle = 4$ argument just displays the top portion of the decision tree. \nExploiting Context \nBy augmenting the feature extraction function, we could modify this part-of-speech tagger to leverage a variety of other word-internal features, such as the length of the word, the number of syllables it contains, or its prefix. However, as long as the feature extractor just looks at the target word, we have no way to add features that depend on the context in which the word appears. But contextual features often provide powerful clues about the correct tag—for example, when tagging the word fly, knowing that the previous word is $a$ will allow us to determine that it is functioning as a noun, not a verb. \nIn order to accommodate features that depend on a word’s context, we must revise the pattern that we used to define our feature extractor. Instead of just passing in the word to be tagged, we will pass in a complete (untagged) sentence, along with the index of the target word. This approach is demonstrated in Example 6-4, which employs a context-dependent feature extractor to define a part-of-speech tag classifier. \nExample 6-4. A part-of-speech classifier whose feature detector examines the context in which a word appears in order to determine which part-of-speech tag should be assigned. In particular, the identity of the previous word is included as a feature. \ndef pos_features(sentence, i): features $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ {\"suffix(1)\": sentence[i][-1:], \"suffix(2)\": sentence[i][-2:], \"suffix(3)\": sentence[i][-3:]} if $mathrm { ~ i ~ } = = 0$ : features[\"prev-word\"] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"<START>\" else: features[\"prev-word\"] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sentence[i-1] return features   \n>>> pos_features(brown.sents()[0], 8)   \n{'suffix(3)': 'ion', 'prev-word': 'an', 'suffix(2)': 'on', 'suffix(1)': 'n'}   \n$gg >$ tagged_sents $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ brown.tagged_sents(categories $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { dot { tau } }$ news')   \n>>> featuresets $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ []   \n>>> for tagged_sent in tagged_sents: untagged_sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.tag.untag(tagged_sent) for i, (word, tag) in enumerate(tagged_sent): featuresets.append(   \n(pos_features(untagged_sent, i), tag) )   \n>>> size $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ int(len(featuresets) $*  0 . 1 $ )   \n>>> train_set, test_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ featuresets[size:], featuresets[:size]   \n>>> classifier $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set)   \n>>> nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set)   \n0.78915962207856782 \nIt’s clear that exploiting contextual features improves the performance of our part-ofspeech tagger. For example, the classifier learns that a word is likely to be a noun if it comes immediately after the word large or the word gubernatorial. However, it is unable to learn the generalization that a word is probably a noun if it follows an adjective, because it doesn’t have access to the previous word’s part-of-speech tag. In general, simple classifiers always treat each input as independent from all other inputs. In many contexts, this makes perfect sense. For example, decisions about whether names tend to be male or female can be made on a case-by-case basis. However, there are often cases, such as part-of-speech tagging, where we are interested in solving classification problems that are closely related to one another. \nSequence Classification \nIn order to capture the dependencies between related classification tasks, we can use joint classifier models, which choose an appropriate labeling for a collection of related inputs. In the case of part-of-speech tagging, a variety of different sequence classifier models can be used to jointly choose part-of-speech tags for all the words in a given sentence.",

However, there are often cases, such as part-of-speech tagging, where we are interested in solving classification problems that are closely related to one another. \nSequence Classification \nIn order to capture the dependencies between related classification tasks, we can use joint classifier models, which choose an appropriate labeling for a collection of related inputs. In the case of part-of-speech tagging, a variety of different sequence classifier models can be used to jointly choose part-of-speech tags for all the words in a given sentence. \nOne sequence classification strategy, known as consecutive classification or greedy sequence classification, is to find the most likely class label for the first input, then to use that answer to help find the best label for the next input. The process can then be repeated until all of the inputs have been labeled. This is the approach that was taken by the bigram tagger from Section 5.5, which began by choosing a part-of-speech tag for the first word in the sentence, and then chose the tag for each subsequent word based on the word itself and the predicted tag for the previous word. \nThis strategy is demonstrated in Example 6-5. First, we must augment our feature extractor function to take a history argument, which provides a list of the tags that we’ve predicted for the sentence so far $bullet$ . Each tag in history corresponds with a word in sentence. But note that history will only contain tags for words we’ve already classified, that is, words to the left of the target word. Thus, although it is possible to look at some features of words to the right of the target word, it is not possible to look at the tags for those words (since we haven’t generated them yet). \nHaving defined a feature extractor, we can proceed to build our sequence classifier . During training, we use the annotated tags to provide the appropriate history to the feature extractor, but when tagging new sentences, we generate the history list based on the output of the tagger itself. \nExample 6-5. Part-of-speech tagging with a consecutive classifier. \ndef pos_features(sentence, i, history): features $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ {\"suffix(1)\": sentence[i][-1:], \"suffix(2)\": sentence[i][-2:], \"suffix(3)\": sentence[i][-3:]} if $mathrm { ~ i ~ } = 0$ : features[\"prev-word\"] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"<START>\" features[\"prev-tag\"] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"<START>\" else: features[\"prev-word\"] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sentence[i-1] features[\"prev-tag\"] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ history[i-1] return features   \nclass ConsecutivePosTagger(nltk.TaggerI): def __init__(self, train_sents): train_set $= [ ]$ for tagged_sent in train_sents: untagged_sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.tag.untag(tagged_sent) history $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [] for i, (word, tag) in enumerate(tagged_sent): featureset $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ pos_features(untagged_sent, i, history) train_set.append( (featureset, tag) ) history.append(tag) self.classifier $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set) def tag(self, sentence): history $= [ ]$ for i, word in enumerate(sentence): featureset $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ pos_features(sentence, i, history) \ntag $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ self.classifier.classify(featureset) history.append(tag) return zip(sentence, history) >>> tagged_sents $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ brown.tagged_sents(categories $ v { S } =$ 'news') >>> size $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ int(len(tagged_sents) * 0.1) >>> train_sents, test_sents $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ tagged_sents[size:], tagged_sents[:size] >>> tagger $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ConsecutivePosTagger(train_sents) >>> print tagger.evaluate(test_sents) 0.79796012981 \nOther Methods for Sequence Classification \nOne shortcoming of this approach is that we commit to every decision that we make. For example, if we decide to label a word as a noun, but later find evidence that it should have been a verb, there’s no way to go back and fix our mistake. One solution to this problem is to adopt a transformational strategy instead. Transformational joint classifiers work by creating an initial assignment of labels for the inputs, and then iteratively refining that assignment in an attempt to repair inconsistencies between related inputs. The Brill tagger, described in Section 5.6, is a good example of this strategy. \nAnother solution is to assign scores to all of the possible sequences of part-of-speech tags, and to choose the sequence whose overall score is highest. This is the approach taken by Hidden Markov Models. Hidden Markov Models are similar to consecutive classifiers in that they look at both the inputs and the history of predicted tags. However, rather than simply finding the single best tag for a given word, they generate a probability distribution over tags. These probabilities are then combined to calculate probability scores for tag sequences, and the tag sequence with the highest probability is chosen. Unfortunately, the number of possible tag sequences is quite large. Given a tag set with 30 tags, there are about 600 trillion $( 3 0 ^ { 1 0 } )$ ways to label a 10-word sentence. In order to avoid considering all these possible sequences separately, Hidden Markov Models require that the feature extractor only look at the most recent tag (or the most recent $n$ tags, where $n$ is fairly small). Given that restriction, it is possible to use dynamic programming (Section 4.7) to efficiently find the most likely tag sequence. In particular, for each consecutive word index $i$ , a score is computed for each possible current and previous tag. This same basic approach is taken by two more advanced models, called Maximum Entropy Markov Models and Linear-Chain Conditional Random Field Models; but different algorithms are used to find scores for tag sequences. \n6.2  Further Examples of Supervised Classification \nSentence Segmentation \nSentence segmentation can be viewed as a classification task for punctuation: whenever we encounter a symbol that could possibly end a sentence, such as a period or a question mark, we have to decide whether it terminates the preceding sentence.",

Next, we need to specify the features of the data that will be used in order to decide whether punctuation indicates a sentence boundary: \n>>> def punct_f $ begin{array} { r l } & { cdot mathsf { e a t u r e s } ( mathsf { t o k e n s } ,  mathbf { i } ) : }  & { { mathbf { phi } ^ { prime } mathsf { n e x t - w o r d - c a p i t a l i z e d } ^ { prime } :  mathsf { t o k e n s } [ mathbf { i + 1 } ] left[ 0 right] . mathbf { i } mathsf { s u p p e r } ( ) , }  & { cdot underbrace { mathsf { p r e v w o r d } ^ { prime } :  mathbf { t o k e n s } [ mathbf { i - 1 } ] . mathbf { l o w e r } ( ) } _ { mathrm { p u n c t ~ : ~ } } , }  & { cdot underbrace { mathsf { p u n c t } ^ { prime } :  pm mathsf { t o k e n s } [ mathbf { i } ] } _ { mathrm { p r e v - w o r d - i s - o n e - c h a r } ^ { prime } :  mathbf { l e n } ( pm mathsf { t o k e n s } [ mathbf { i - 1 } ] )  =  mathbf { 1 } } } end{array} }$ return \nBased on this feature extractor, we can create a list of labeled featuresets by selecting all the punctuation tokens, and tagging whether they are boundary tokens or not: \n>>> featuresets $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(punct_features(tokens, i), (i in boundaries)) for i in range(1, len(tokens)-1) if tokens[i] in '.?!'] \nUsing these featuresets, we can train and evaluate a punctuation classifier: \n>>> size $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ int(len(featuresets) $*  0 . 1 dot { } ,$   \n>>> train_set, test_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ featuresets[size:], featuresets[:size]   \n>>> classifier $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set)   \n>>> nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set)   \n0.97419354838709682 \nTo use this classifier to perform sentence segmentation, we simply check each punctuation mark to see whether it’s labeled as a boundary, and divide the list of words at the boundary marks. The listing in Example 6-6 shows how this can be done. \nExample 6-6. Classification-based sentence segmenter. \ndef segment_sentences(words): start $mathbf { varepsilon } = mathbf { varepsilon } _ { 0 }$ sents $= [ ]$ for i, word in words: if word in '.?!' and classifier.classify(words, i) $scriptstyle = =$ True: sents.append(words[start: $mathbf { i } { + } 1 ^ { cdot }$ ]) start $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma } _ { mathbf { i } + 1 }$ if start < len(words): sents.append(words[start:]) \nIdentifying Dialogue Act Types \nWhen processing dialogue, it can be useful to think of utterances as a type of action performed by the speaker. This interpretation is most straightforward for performative statements such as I forgive you or I bet you can’t climb that hill. But greetings, questions, answers, assertions, and clarifications can all be thought of as types of speech-based actions. Recognizing the dialogue acts underlying the utterances in a dialogue can be an important first step in understanding the conversation. \nThe NPS Chat Corpus, which was demonstrated in Section 2.1, consists of over 10,000 posts from instant messaging sessions. These posts have all been labeled with one of 15 dialogue act types, such as “Statement,” “Emotion,” “ynQuestion,” and “Continuer.” We can therefore use this data to build a classifier that can identify the dialogue act types for new instant messaging posts. The first step is to extract the basic messaging data. We will call xml_posts() to get a data structure representing the XML annotation for each post: \n>>> posts $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.nps_chat.xml_posts()[:10000] \nNext, we’ll define a simple feature extractor that checks what words the post contains: \n>>> def dialogue_act_features(post): features $dot { mathbf { beta } } = { overline { { beta } }$ for word in nltk.word_tokenize(post): features['contains(%s)' % word.lower()] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ True return features \nFinally, we construct the training and testing data by applying the feature extractor to each post (using post.get('class') to get a post’s dialogue act type), and create a new classifier: \n>>> featuresets $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(dialogue_act_features(post.text), post.get('class')) for post in posts]   \n>>> size $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ int(len(featuresets) $*  0 . 1 rangle$ )   \n>>> train_set, test_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ featuresets[size:], featuresets[:size]   \n>>> classifier $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set)   \n>>> print nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set)   \n0.66 \nRecognizing Textual Entailment \nRecognizing textual entailment (RTE) is the task of determining whether a given piece of text $T$ entails another text called the “hypothesis” (as already discussed in Section 1.5). To date, there have been four RTE Challenges, where shared development and test data is made available to competing teams. Here are a couple of examples of text/hypothesis pairs from the Challenge 3 development dataset. The label True indicates that the entailment holds, and False indicates that it fails to hold.",

We will call xml_posts() to get a data structure representing the XML annotation for each post: \n>>> posts $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.nps_chat.xml_posts()[:10000] \nNext, we’ll define a simple feature extractor that checks what words the post contains: \n>>> def dialogue_act_features(post): features $dot { mathbf { beta } } = { overline { { beta } }$ for word in nltk.word_tokenize(post): features['contains(%s)' % word.lower()] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ True return features \nFinally, we construct the training and testing data by applying the feature extractor to each post (using post.get('class') to get a post’s dialogue act type), and create a new classifier: \n>>> featuresets $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(dialogue_act_features(post.text), post.get('class')) for post in posts]   \n>>> size $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ int(len(featuresets) $*  0 . 1 rangle$ )   \n>>> train_set, test_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ featuresets[size:], featuresets[:size]   \n>>> classifier $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set)   \n>>> print nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set)   \n0.66 \nRecognizing Textual Entailment \nRecognizing textual entailment (RTE) is the task of determining whether a given piece of text $T$ entails another text called the “hypothesis” (as already discussed in Section 1.5). To date, there have been four RTE Challenges, where shared development and test data is made available to competing teams. Here are a couple of examples of text/hypothesis pairs from the Challenge 3 development dataset. The label True indicates that the entailment holds, and False indicates that it fails to hold. \nChallenge 3, Pair 34 (True) \nT: Parviz Davudi was representing Iran at a meeting of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), the fledgling association that binds Russia, China and four former Soviet republics of central Asia together to fight terrorism. \nH: China is a member of SCO. \nChallenge 3, Pair 81 (False) \nT: According to NC Articles of Organization, the members of LLC company are H. Nelson Beavers, III, H. Chester Beavers and Jennie Beavers Stewart. H: Jennie Beavers Stewart is a share-holder of Carolina Analytical Laboratory. \nIt should be emphasized that the relationship between text and hypothesis is not intended to be logical entailment, but rather whether a human would conclude that the text provides reasonable evidence for taking the hypothesis to be true. \nWe can treat RTE as a classification task, in which we try to predict the True/False label for each pair. Although it seems likely that successful approaches to this task will involve a combination of parsing, semantics, and real-world knowledge, many early attempts at RTE achieved reasonably good results with shallow analysis, based on similarity between the text and hypothesis at the word level. In the ideal case, we would expect that if there is an entailment, then all the information expressed by the hypothesis should also be present in the text. Conversely, if there is information found in the hypothesis that is absent from the text, then there will be no entailment. \nIn our RTE feature detector (Example 6-7), we let words (i.e., word types) serve as proxies for information, and our features count the degree of word overlap, and the degree to which there are words in the hypothesis but not in the text (captured by the method hyp_extra()). Not all words are equally important—named entity mentions, such as the names of people, organizations, and places, are likely to be more significant, which motivates us to extract distinct information for words and nes (named entities). In addition, some high-frequency function words are filtered out as “stopwords.” \nExample 6-7. “Recognizing Text Entailment” feature extractor: The RTEFeatureExtractor class builds a bag of words for both the text and the hypothesis after throwing away some stopwords, then calculates overlap and difference. \ndef rte_features(rtepair): extractor $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.RTEFeatureExtractor(rtepair) features $= { }$ features['word_overlap'] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(extractor.overlap('word')) features['word_hyp_extra'] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(extractor.hyp_extra('word')) features['ne_overlap'] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(extractor.overlap('ne')) features['ne_hyp_extra'] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ len(extractor.hyp_extra('ne')) return features \nTo illustrate the content of these features, we examine some attributes of the text/ hypothesis Pair 34 shown earlier: \n>>> rtepair $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.rte.pairs(['rte3_dev.xml'])[33]   \n>>> extractor $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.RTEFeatureExtractor(rtepair)   \n>>> print extractor.text_words   \nset(['Russia', 'Organisation', 'Shanghai', 'Asia', 'four', 'at',   \n'operation', 'SCO', ...])   \n>>> print extractor.hyp_words   \nset(['member', 'SCO', 'China'])   \n>>> print extractor.overlap('word')   \nset([])   \n>>> print extractor.overlap('ne')   \nset(['SCO', 'China'])   \n>>> print extractor.hyp_extra('word')   \nset(['member']) \nThese features indicate that all important words in the hypothesis are contained in the text, and thus there is some evidence for labeling this as True. \nThe module nltk.classify.rte_classify reaches just over $5 8 %$ accuracy on the combined RTE test data using methods like these. Although this figure is not very impressive, it requires significant effort, and more linguistic processing, to achieve much better results. \nScaling Up to Large Datasets \nPython provides an excellent environment for performing basic text processing and feature extraction. However, it is not able to perform the numerically intensive calculations required by machine learning methods nearly as quickly as lower-level languages such as C. Thus, if you attempt to use the pure-Python machine learning implementations (such as nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier) on large datasets, you may find that the learning algorithm takes an unreasonable amount of time and memory to complete. \nIf you plan to train classifiers with large amounts of training data or a large number of features, we recommend that you explore NLTK’s facilities for interfacing with external machine learning packages. Once these packages have been installed, NLTK can transparently invoke them (via system calls) to train classifier models significantly faster than the pure-Python classifier implementations. See the NLTK web page for a list of recommended machine learning packages that are supported by NLTK. \n6.3  Evaluation \nIn order to decide whether a classification model is accurately capturing a pattern, we must evaluate that model. The result of this evaluation is important for deciding how trustworthy the model is, and for what purposes we can use it. Evaluation can also be an effective tool for guiding us in making future improvements to the model. \nThe Test Set \nMost evaluation techniques calculate a score for a model by comparing the labels that it generates for the inputs in a test set (or evaluation set) with the correct labels for those inputs. This test set typically has the same format as the training set. However, it is very important that the test set be distinct from the training corpus: if we simply reused the training set as the test set, then a model that simply memorized its input, without learning how to generalize to new examples, would receive misleadingly high scores.",

The result of this evaluation is important for deciding how trustworthy the model is, and for what purposes we can use it. Evaluation can also be an effective tool for guiding us in making future improvements to the model. \nThe Test Set \nMost evaluation techniques calculate a score for a model by comparing the labels that it generates for the inputs in a test set (or evaluation set) with the correct labels for those inputs. This test set typically has the same format as the training set. However, it is very important that the test set be distinct from the training corpus: if we simply reused the training set as the test set, then a model that simply memorized its input, without learning how to generalize to new examples, would receive misleadingly high scores. \n\nWhen building the test set, there is often a trade-off between the amount of data available for testing and the amount available for training. For classification tasks that have a small number of well-balanced labels and a diverse test set, a meaningful evaluation can be performed with as few as 100 evaluation instances. But if a classification task has a large number of labels or includes very infrequent labels, then the size of the test set should be chosen to ensure that the least frequent label occurs at least 50 times. Additionally, if the test set contains many closely related instances—such as instances drawn from a single document—then the size of the test set should be increased to ensure that this lack of diversity does not skew the evaluation results. When large amounts of annotated data are available, it is common to err on the side of safety by using $1 0 %$ of the overall data for evaluation. \nAnother consideration when choosing the test set is the degree of similarity between instances in the test set and those in the development set. The more similar these two datasets are, the less confident we can be that evaluation results will generalize to other datasets. For example, consider the part-of-speech tagging task. At one extreme, we could create the training set and test set by randomly assigning sentences from a data source that reflects a single genre, such as news: \n>>> import random   \n>>> from nltk.corpus import brown   \n>>> tagged_sents $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ list(brown.tagged_sents(categories $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'news'))   \n>>> random.shuffle(tagged_sents)   \n>>> size $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ int(len(tagged_sents) * 0.1)   \n>>> train_set, test_set $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ tagged_sents[size:], tagged_sents[:size] \nIn this case, our test set will be very similar to our training set. The training set and test set are taken from the same genre, and so we cannot be confident that evaluation results would generalize to other genres. What’s worse, because of the call to random.shuffle(), the test set contains sentences that are taken from the same documents that were used for training. If there is any consistent pattern within a document (say, if a given word appears with a particular part-of-speech tag especially frequently), then that difference will be reflected in both the development set and the test set. A somewhat better approach is to ensure that the training set and test set are taken from different documents: \n>>> file_ids $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown.fileids(categories $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'news') $gg >$ size $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ int(len(file_ids) * 0.1) >>> train_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown.tagged_sents(file_ids[size:]) >>> test_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown.tagged_sents(file_ids[:size]) \nIf we want to perform a more stringent evaluation, we can draw the test set from documents that are less closely related to those in the training set: \n>>> train_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown.tagged_sents(categories $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'news') >>> test_set $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ brown.tagged_sents(categories $mathbf { Psi } = mathbf { Psi }$ 'fiction') \nIf we build a classifier that performs well on this test set, then we can be confident that it has the power to generalize well beyond the data on which it was trained. \nAccuracy \nThe simplest metric that can be used to evaluate a classifier, accuracy, measures the percentage of inputs in the test set that the classifier correctly labeled. For example, a name gender classifier that predicts the correct name 60 times in a test set containing 80 names would have an accuracy of $6 0 / 8 0 = 7 5 %$ . The function nltk.classify.accu racy() will calculate the accuracy of a classifier model on a given test set: \n>>> classifier $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set) >>> print 'Accuracy: $% 4 . 2 4 : %$ nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set) 0.75 \nWhen interpreting the accuracy score of a classifier, it is important to consider the frequencies of the individual class labels in the test set. For example, consider a classifier that determines the correct word sense for each occurrence of the word bank. If we evaluate this classifier on financial newswire text, then we may find that the financialinstitution sense appears 19 times out of 20. In that case, an accuracy of $9 5 %$ would hardly be impressive, since we could achieve that accuracy with a model that always returns the financial-institution sense. However, if we instead evaluate the classifier on a more balanced corpus, where the most frequent word sense has a frequency of $40 %$ , then a $9 5 %$ accuracy score would be a much more positive result. (A similar issue arises when measuring inter-annotator agreement in Section 11.2.) \nPrecision and Recall \nAnother instance where accuracy scores can be misleading is in “search” tasks, such as information retrieval, where we are attempting to find documents that are relevant to a particular task. Since the number of irrelevant documents far outweighs the number of relevant documents, the accuracy score for a model that labels every document as irrelevant would be very close to $100 %$ . \nIt is therefore conventional to employ a different set of measures for search tasks, based on the number of items in each of the four categories shown in Figure 6-3: \n• True positives are relevant items that we correctly identified as relevant.   \n• True negatives are irrelevant items that we correctly identified as irrelevant.   \n• False positives (or Type I errors) are irrelevant items that we incorrectly identified as relevant.   \n• False negatives (or Type II errors) are relevant items that we incorrectly identified as irrelevant.",

As we’ve seen, it’s possible to treat these learning methods as black boxes, simply training models and using them for prediction without understanding how they work. But there’s a lot to be learned from taking a closer look at how these learning methods select models based on the data in a training set. An understanding of these methods can help guide our selection of appropriate features, and especially our decisions about how those features should be encoded. And an understanding of the generated models can allow us to extract information about which features are most informative, and how those features relate to one another. \nA decision tree is a simple flowchart that selects labels for input values. This flowchart consists of decision nodes, which check feature values, and leaf nodes, which assign labels. To choose the label for an input value, we begin at the flowchart’s initial decision node, known as its root node. This node contains a condition that checks one of the input value’s features, and selects a branch based on that feature’s value. Following the branch that describes our input value, we arrive at a new decision node, with a new condition on the input value’s features. We continue following the branch selected by each node’s condition, until we arrive at a leaf node which provides a label for the input value. Figure 6-4 shows an example decision tree model for the name gender task. \nOnce we have a decision tree, it is straightforward to use it to assign labels to new input values. What’s less straightforward is how we can build a decision tree that models a given training set. But before we look at the learning algorithm for building decision trees, we’ll consider a simpler task: picking the best “decision stump” for a corpus. A decision stump is a decision tree with a single node that decides how to classify inputs based on a single feature. It contains one leaf for each possible feature value, specifying the class label that should be assigned to inputs whose features have that value. In order to build a decision stump, we must first decide which feature should be used. The simplest method is to just build a decision stump for each possible feature, and see which one achieves the highest accuracy on the training data, although there are other alternatives that we will discuss later. Once we’ve picked a feature, we can build the decision stump by assigning a label to each leaf based on the most frequent label for the selected examples in the training set (i.e., the examples where the selected feature has that value).",

        "content": "Given the algorithm for choosing decision stumps, the algorithm for growing larger decision trees is straightforward. We begin by selecting the overall best decision stump for the classification task. We then check the accuracy of each of the leaves on the training set. Leaves that do not achieve sufficient accuracy are then replaced by new decision stumps, trained on the subset of the training corpus that is selected by the path to the leaf. For example, we could grow the decision tree in Figure 6-4 by replacing the leftmost leaf with a new decision stump, trained on the subset of the training set names that do not start with a $k$ or end with a vowel or an l. \nEntropy and Information Gain \nAs was mentioned before, there are several methods for identifying the most informative feature for a decision stump. One popular alternative, called information gain, measures how much more organized the input values become when we divide them up using a given feature. To measure how disorganized the original set of input values are, we calculate entropy of their labels, which will be high if the input values have highly varied labels, and low if many input values all have the same label. In particular, entropy is defined as the sum of the probability of each label times the log probability of that same label: \nFor example, Figure 6-5 shows how the entropy of labels in the name gender prediction task depends on the ratio of male to female names. Note that if most input values have the same label (e.g., if $P ( { mathrm { m a l e } } )$ is near 0 or near 1), then entropy is low. In particular, labels that have low frequency do not contribute much to the entropy (since $P ( l )$ is small), and labels with high frequency also do not contribute much to the entropy (since $log _ { 2 } P ( l )$ is small). On the other hand, if the input values have a wide variety of labels, then there are many labels with a “medium” frequency, where neither $P ( l )$ nor $log _ { 2 } P ( l )$ is small, so the entropy is high. Example 6-8 demonstrates how to calculate the entropy of a list of labels. \nExample 6-8. Calculating the entropy of a list of labels. \nimport math   \ndef entropy(labels): freqdist $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FreqDist(labels) probs $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [freqdist.freq(l) for l in nltk.FreqDist(labels)] return -sum([p * math.log(p,2) for p in probs])   \n>>> print entropy(['male', 'male', 'male', 'male'])   \n0.0   \n>>> print entropy(['male', 'female', 'male', 'male'])   \n0.811278124459   \n>>> print entropy(['female', 'male', 'female', 'male'])   \n1.0   \n>>> print entropy(['female', 'female', 'male', 'female'])   \n0.811278124459   \n>>> print entropy(['female', 'female', 'female', 'female'])   \n0.0 \n\nOnce we have calculated the entropy of the labels of the original set of input values, we can determine how much more organized the labels become once we apply the decision stump. To do so, we calculate the entropy for each of the decision stump’s leaves, and take the average of those leaf entropy values (weighted by the number of samples in each leaf). The information gain is then equal to the original entropy minus this new, reduced entropy. The higher the information gain, the better job the decision stump does of dividing the input values into coherent groups, so we can build decision trees by selecting the decision stumps with the highest information gain. \nAnother consideration for decision trees is efficiency. The simple algorithm for selecting decision stumps described earlier must construct a candidate decision stump for every possible feature, and this process must be repeated for every node in the constructed decision tree. A number of algorithms have been developed to cut down on the training time by storing and reusing information about previously evaluated examples. \n\nDecision trees have a number of useful qualities. To begin with, they’re simple to understand, and easy to interpret. This is especially true near the top of the decision tree, where it is usually possible for the learning algorithm to find very useful features. Decision trees are especially well suited to cases where many hierarchical categorical distinctions can be made. For example, decision trees can be very effective at capturing phylogeny trees. \nHowever, decision trees also have a few disadvantages. One problem is that, since each branch in the decision tree splits the training data, the amount of training data available to train nodes lower in the tree can become quite small. As a result, these lower decision nodes may overfit the training set, learning patterns that reflect idiosyncrasies of the training set rather than linguistically significant patterns in the underlying problem. One solution to this problem is to stop dividing nodes once the amount of training data becomes too small. Another solution is to grow a full decision tree, but then to prune decision nodes that do not improve performance on a dev-test. \nA second problem with decision trees is that they force features to be checked in a specific order, even when features may act relatively independently of one another. For example, when classifying documents into topics (such as sports, automotive, or murder mystery), features such as hasword(football) are highly indicative of a specific label, regardless of what the other feature values are. Since there is limited space near the top of the decision tree, most of these features will need to be repeated on many different branches in the tree. And since the number of branches increases exponentially as we go down the tree, the amount of repetition can be very large. \nA related problem is that decision trees are not good at making use of features that are weak predictors of the correct label. Since these features make relatively small incremental improvements, they tend to occur very low in the decision tree. But by the time the decision tree learner has descended far enough to use these features, there is not enough training data left to reliably determine what effect they should have. If we could instead look at the effect of these features across the entire training set, then we might be able to make some conclusions about how they should affect the choice of label. \nThe fact that decision trees require that features be checked in a specific order limits their ability to exploit features that are relatively independent of one another. The naive Bayes classification method, which we’ll discuss next, overcomes this limitation by allowing all features to act “in parallel.” \n6.5  Naive Bayes Classifiers \nIn naive Bayes classifiers, every feature gets a say in determining which label should be assigned to a given input value. To choose a label for an input value, the naive Bayes classifier begins by calculating the prior probability of each label, which is determined by checking the frequency of each label in the training set. The contribution from each feature is then combined with this prior probability, to arrive at a likelihood estimate for each label. The label whose likelihood estimate is the highest is then assigned to the input value. Figure 6-6 illustrates this process.",

        "content": "Underlying Probabilistic Model \nAnother way of understanding the naive Bayes classifier is that it chooses the most likely label for an input, under the assumption that every input value is generated by first choosing a class label for that input value, and then generating each feature, entirely independent of every other feature. Of course, this assumption is unrealistic; features are often highly dependent on one another. We’ll return to some of the consequences of this assumption at the end of this section. This simplifying assumption, known as the naive Bayes assumption (or independence assumption), makes it much easier to combine the contributions of the different features, since we don’t need to worry about how they should interact with one another. \n\nBased on this assumption, we can calculate an expression for P(label|features), the probability that an input will have a particular label given that it has a particular set of features. To choose a label for a new input, we can then simply pick the label $l$ that maximizes P(l|features). \nTo begin, we note that P(label|features) is equal to the probability that an input has a particular label and the specified set of features, divided by the probability that it has the specified set of features: \nNext, we note that $P ( f e a t u r e s )$ will be the same for every choice of label, so if we are simply interested in finding the most likely label, it suffices to calculate P(features, label), which we’ll call the label likelihood. \nIf we want to generate a probability estimate for each label, rather than just choosing the most likely label, then the easiest way to compute P(features) is to simply calculate the sum over labels of P(features, label): \nThe label likelihood can be expanded out as the probability of the label times the probability of the features given the label: \nFurthermore, since the features are all independent of one another (given the label), we can separate out the probability of each individual feature: \nThis is exactly the equation we discussed earlier for calculating the label likelihood: $P ( l a b e l )$ is the prior probability for a given label, and each $P ( f | l a b e l )$ is the contribution of a single feature to the label likelihood. \nZero Counts and Smoothing \nThe simplest way to calculate $P ( f | l a b e l )$ , the contribution of a feature $f$ toward the label likelihood for a label label, is to take the percentage of training instances with the given label that also have the given feature:",

In this case, our calculated value for $P ( f | l a b e l )$ will be zero, which will cause the label likelihood for the given label to be zero. Thus, the input will never be assigned this label, regardless of how well the other features fit the label. \nThe basic problem here is with our calculation of $P ( f | l a b e l )$ , the probability that an input will have a feature, given a label. In particular, just because we haven’t seen a feature/label combination occur in the training set, doesn’t mean it’s impossible for that combination to occur. For example, we may not have seen any murder mystery documents that contained the word football, but we wouldn’t want to conclude that it’s completely impossible for such documents to exist. \nThus, although count(f,label)/count(label) is a good estimate for $P ( f | l a b e l )$ when count $( f ,$ label) is relatively high, this estimate becomes less reliable when $c o u n t ( f )$ becomes smaller. Therefore, when building naive Bayes models, we usually employ more sophisticated techniques, known as smoothing techniques, for calculating $P ( f | l a b e l )$ , the probability of a feature given a label. For example, the Expected Likelihood Estimation for the probability of a feature given a label basically adds 0.5 to each $c o u n t ( f , l a b e l )$ value, and the Heldout Estimation uses a heldout corpus to calculate the relationship between feature frequencies and feature probabilities. The nltk.prob ability module provides support for a wide variety of smoothing techniques. \nNon-Binary Features \nWe have assumed here that each feature is binary, i.e., that each input either has a feature or does not. Label-valued features (e.g., a color feature, which could be red, green, blue, white, or orange) can be converted to binary features by replacing them with binary features, such as “color-is-red”. Numeric features can be converted to binary features by binning, which replaces them with features such as $scriptstyle { ^ { mathfrak { s } } 4 < _ { mathrm { X } } < 6 }$ .” \nAnother alternative is to use regression methods to model the probabilities of numeric features. For example, if we assume that the height feature has a bell curve distribution, then we could estimate $P ( h e i g h t | l a b e l )$ by finding the mean and variance of the heights of the inputs with each label. In this case, $P ( f = nu | l a b e l )$ would not be a fixed value, but would vary depending on the value of $nu$ . \nThe Naivete of Independence \nThe reason that naive Bayes classifiers are called “naive” is that it’s unreasonable to assume that all features are independent of one another (given the label). In particular, almost all real-world problems contain features with varying degrees of dependence on one another.

One problem that arises is that the classifier can end up “double-counting” the effect of highly correlated features, pushing the classifier closer to a given label than is justified. \nTo see how this can occur, consider a name gender classifier that contains two identical features, $f _ { 1 }$ and $f _ { 2 }$ . In other words, $f _ { 2 }$ is an exact copy of $f _ { 1 }$ , and contains no new information. When the classifier is considering an input, it will include the contribution of both $f _ { 1 }$ and $f _ { 2 }$ when deciding which label to choose. Thus, the information content of these two features will be given more weight than it deserves. \nOf course, we don’t usually build naive Bayes classifiers that contain two identical features. However, we do build classifiers that contain features which are dependent on one another. For example, the features ends-with(a) and ends-with(vowel) are dependent on one another, because if an input value has the first feature, then it must also have the second feature. For features like these, the duplicated information may be given more weight than is justified by the training set. \nThe Cause of Double-Counting \nThe reason for the double-counting problem is that during training, feature contributions are computed separately; but when using the classifier to choose labels for new inputs, those feature contributions are combined.

In particular, it looks for the set of parameters that maximizes the total likelihood of the training corpus, which is defined as: \nWhere P(label|features), the probability that an input whose features are features will have class label label, is defined as: \n(11) \nBecause of the potentially complex interactions between the effects of related features, there is no way to directly calculate the model parameters that maximize the likelihood of the training set. Therefore, Maximum Entropy classifiers choose the model parameters using iterative optimization techniques, which initialize the model’s parameters to random values, and then repeatedly refine those parameters to bring them closer to the optimal solution. These iterative optimization techniques guarantee that each refinement of the parameters will bring them closer to the optimal values, but do not necessarily provide a means of determining when those optimal values have been reached. Because the parameters for Maximum Entropy classifiers are selected using iterative optimization techniques, they can take a long time to learn. This is especially true when the size of the training set, the number of features, and the number of labels are all large. \nSome iterative optimization techniques are much faster than others. When training Maximum Entropy models, avoid the use of Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) or Improved Iterative Scaling (IIS), which are both considerably slower than the Conjugate Gradient (CG) and the BFGS optimization methods. \nThe Maximum Entropy Model \nThe Maximum Entropy classifier model is a generalization of the model used by the naive Bayes classifier. Like the naive Bayes model, the Maximum Entropy classifier calculates the likelihood of each label for a given input value by multiplying together the parameters that are applicable for the input value and label. The naive Bayes classifier model defines a parameter for each label, specifying its prior probability, and a parameter for each (feature, label) pair, specifying the contribution of individual features toward a label’s likelihood. \nIn contrast, the Maximum Entropy classifier model leaves it up to the user to decide what combinations of labels and features should receive their own parameters. In particular, it is possible to use a single parameter to associate a feature with more than one label; or to associate more than one feature with a given label. This will sometimes allow the model to “generalize” over some of the differences between related labels or features. \n\nEach combination of labels and features that receives its own parameter is called a joint-feature. Note that joint-features are properties of labeled values, whereas (simple) features are properties of unlabeled values. \nIn literature that describes and discusses Maximum Entropy models, the term “features” often refers to joint-features; the term “contexts” refers to what we have been calling (simple) features. \nTypically, the joint-features that are used to construct Maximum Entropy models exactly mirror those that are used by the naive Bayes model. In particular, a joint-feature is defined for each label, corresponding to w[label], and for each combination of (simple) feature and label, corresponding to $w [ f ,$ label]. Given the joint-features for a Maximum Entropy model, the score assigned to a label for a given input is simply the product of the parameters associated with the joint-features that apply to that input and label: \nMaximizing Entropy \nThe intuition that motivates Maximum Entropy classification is that we should build a model that captures the frequencies of individual joint-features, without making any unwarranted assumptions. An example will help to illustrate this principle. \nSuppose we are assigned the task of picking the correct word sense for a given word, from a list of 10 possible senses (labeled A–J). At first, we are not told anything more about the word or the senses. There are many probability distributions that we could choose for the 10 senses, such as: \nAlthough any of these distributions might be correct, we are likely to choose distribution $( i )$ , because without any more information, there is no reason to believe that any word sense is more likely than any other.

        "content": "Each combination of labels and features that receives its own parameter is called a joint-feature. Note that joint-features are properties of labeled values, whereas (simple) features are properties of unlabeled values. \nIn literature that describes and discusses Maximum Entropy models, the term “features” often refers to joint-features; the term “contexts” refers to what we have been calling (simple) features. \nTypically, the joint-features that are used to construct Maximum Entropy models exactly mirror those that are used by the naive Bayes model. In particular, a joint-feature is defined for each label, corresponding to w[label], and for each combination of (simple) feature and label, corresponding to $w [ f ,$ label]. Given the joint-features for a Maximum Entropy model, the score assigned to a label for a given input is simply the product of the parameters associated with the joint-features that apply to that input and label: \nMaximizing Entropy \nThe intuition that motivates Maximum Entropy classification is that we should build a model that captures the frequencies of individual joint-features, without making any unwarranted assumptions. An example will help to illustrate this principle. \nSuppose we are assigned the task of picking the correct word sense for a given word, from a list of 10 possible senses (labeled A–J). At first, we are not told anything more about the word or the senses. There are many probability distributions that we could choose for the 10 senses, such as: \nAlthough any of these distributions might be correct, we are likely to choose distribution $( i )$ , because without any more information, there is no reason to believe that any word sense is more likely than any other. On the other hand, distributions (ii) and (iii) reflect assumptions that are not supported by what we know. \nOne way to capture this intuition that distribution $( i )$ is more “fair” than the other two is to invoke the concept of entropy. In the discussion of decision trees, we described entropy as a measure of how “disorganized” a set of labels was. In particular, if a single label dominates then entropy is low, but if the labels are more evenly distributed then entropy is high. In our example, we chose distribution $( i )$ because its label probabilities are evenly distributed—in other words, because its entropy is high. In general, the Maximum Entropy principle states that, among the distributions that are consistent with what we know, we should choose the distribution whose entropy is highest. \n\nNext, suppose that we are told that sense A appears $5 5 %$ of the time. Once again, there are many distributions that are consistent with this new piece of information, such as: \nBut again, we will likely choose the distribution that makes the fewest unwarranted assumptions—in this case, distribution (v). \nFinally, suppose that we are told that the word up appears in the nearby context $10 %$ of the time, and that when it does appear in the context there’s an $8 0 %$ chance that sense A or C will be used. In this case, we will have a harder time coming up with an appropriate distribution by hand; however, we can verify that the following distribution looks appropriate: \nIn particular, the distribution is consistent with what we know: if we add up the probabilities in column A, we get $5 5 %$ ; if we add up the probabilities of row 1, we get $10 %$ ; and if we add up the boxes for senses A and C in the $+ mu rho$ row, we get $8 %$ (or $8 0 %$ of the $+ mathrm { { u p } }$ cases). Furthermore, the remaining probabilities appear to be “evenly distributed.” \nThroughout this example, we have restricted ourselves to distributions that are consistent with what we know; among these, we chose the distribution with the highest entropy. This is exactly what the Maximum Entropy classifier does as well. In particular, for each joint-feature, the Maximum Entropy model calculates the “empirical frequency” of that feature—i.e., the frequency with which it occurs in the training set. It then searches for the distribution which maximizes entropy, while still predicting the correct frequency for each joint-feature. \nGenerative Versus Conditional Classifiers \nAn important difference between the naive Bayes classifier and the Maximum Entropy classifier concerns the types of questions they can be used to answer. The naive Bayes classifier is an example of a generative classifier, which builds a model that predicts P(input, label), the joint probability of an (input, label) pair. As a result, generative models can be used to answer the following questions: \n1. What is the most likely label for a given input?   \n2. How likely is a given label for a given input?   \n3. What is the most likely input value?   \n4. How likely is a given input value?   \n5. How likely is a given input value with a given label?   \n6. What is the most likely label for an input that might have one of two values (but   \nwe don’t know which)? \nThe Maximum Entropy classifier, on the other hand, is an example of a conditional classifier. Conditional classifiers build models that predict $P ( l a b e l | i n p u t )$ —the probability of a label given the input value. Thus, conditional models can still be used to answer questions 1 and 2. However, conditional models cannot be used to answer the remaining questions 3–6. \nIn general, generative models are strictly more powerful than conditional models, since we can calculate the conditional probability $P ( l a b e l | i n p u t )$ from the joint probability P(input, label), but not vice versa. However, this additional power comes at a price. Because the model is more powerful, it has more “free parameters” that need to be learned. However, the size of the training set is fixed. Thus, when using a more powerful model, we end up with less data that can be used to train each parameter’s value, making it harder to find the best parameter values. As a result, a generative model may not do as good a job at answering questions 1 and 2 as a conditional model, since the conditional model can focus its efforts on those two questions. However, if we do need answers to questions like 3–6, then we have no choice but to use a generative model. \nThe difference between a generative model and a conditional model is analogous to the difference between a topographical map and a picture of a skyline. Although the topographical map can be used to answer a wider variety of questions, it is significantly more difficult to generate an accurate topographical map than it is to generate an accurate skyline. \n6.7  Modeling Linguistic Patterns \nClassifiers can help us to understand the linguistic patterns that occur in natural language, by allowing us to create explicit models that capture those patterns. Typically, these models are using supervised classification techniques, but it is also possible to build analytically motivated models. Either way, these explicit models serve two important purposes: they help us to understand linguistic patterns, and they can be used to make predictions about new language data.",

        "content": "The extent to which explicit models can give us insights into linguistic patterns depends largely on what kind of model is used. Some models, such as decision trees, are relatively transparent, and give us direct information about which factors are important in making decisions and about which factors are related to one another. Other models, such as multilevel neural networks, are much more opaque. Although it can be possible to gain insight by studying them, it typically takes a lot more work. \nBut all explicit models can make predictions about new unseen language data that was not included in the corpus used to build the model. These predictions can be evaluated to assess the accuracy of the model. Once a model is deemed sufficiently accurate, it can then be used to automatically predict information about new language data. These predictive models can be combined into systems that perform many useful language processing tasks, such as document classification, automatic translation, and question answering. \nWhat Do Models Tell Us? \nIt’s important to understand what we can learn about language from an automatically constructed model. One important consideration when dealing with models of language is the distinction between descriptive models and explanatory models. Descriptive models capture patterns in the data, but they don’t provide any information about why the data contains those patterns. For example, as we saw in Table 3-1, the synonyms absolutely and definitely are not interchangeable: we say absolutely adore not definitely adore, and definitely prefer, not absolutely prefer. In contrast, explanatory models attempt to capture properties and relationships that cause the linguistic patterns. For example, we might introduce the abstract concept of “polar adjective” as an adjective that has an extreme meaning, and categorize some adjectives, such as adore and detest as polar. Our explanatory model would contain the constraint that absolutely can combine only with polar adjectives, and definitely can only combine with non-polar adjectives. In summary, descriptive models provide information about correlations in the data, while explanatory models go further to postulate causal relationships. \nMost models that are automatically constructed from a corpus are descriptive models; in other words, they can tell us what features are relevant to a given pattern or construction, but they can’t necessarily tell us how those features and patterns relate to one another. If our goal is to understand the linguistic patterns, then we can use this information about which features are related as a starting point for further experiments designed to tease apart the relationships between features and patterns. On the other hand, if we’re just interested in using the model to make predictions (e.g., as part of a language processing system), then we can use the model to make predictions about new data without worrying about the details of underlying causal relationships. \n6.8  Summary \n• Modeling the linguistic data found in corpora can help us to understand linguistic patterns, and can be used to make predictions about new language data.   \n） Supervised classifiers use labeled training corpora to build models that predict the label of an input based on specific features of that input. Supervised classifiers can perform a wide variety of NLP tasks, including document classification, part-of-speech tagging, sentence segmentation, dialogue act type identification, and determining entailment relations, and many other tasks.   \n• When training a supervised classifier, you should split your corpus into three datasets: a training set for building the classifier model, a dev-test set for helping select and tune the model’s features, and a test set for evaluating the final model’s performance.   \n• When evaluating a supervised classifier, it is important that you use fresh data that was not included in the training or dev-test set. Otherwise, your evaluation results may be unrealistically optimistic.   \nDecision trees are automatically constructed tree-structured flowcharts that are used to assign labels to input values based on their features. Although they’re easy to interpret, they are not very good at handling cases where feature values interact in determining the proper label.   \n• In naive Bayes classifiers, each feature independently contributes to the decision of which label should be used. This allows feature values to interact, but can be problematic when two or more features are highly correlated with one another.   \nMaximum Entropy classifiers use a basic model that is similar to the model used by naive Bayes; however, they employ iterative optimization to find the set of feature weights that maximizes the probability of the training set.   \nMost of the models that are automatically constructed from a corpus are descriptive, that is, they let us know which features are relevant to a given pattern or construction, but they don’t give any information about causal relationships between those features and patterns. \n6.9  Further Reading \nPlease consult http://www.nltk.org/ for further materials on this chapter and on how to install external machine learning packages, such as Weka, Mallet, TADM, and MegaM.

Can you explain why these particular features are informative? Do you find any of them surprising? \n5. ○ Select one of the classification tasks described in this chapter, such as name gender detection, document classification, part-of-speech tagging, or dialogue act classification. Using the same training and test data, and the same feature extractor, build three classifiers for the task: a decision tree, a naive Bayes classifier, and a Maximum Entropy classifier.

What features are relevant in this distinction? Build a classifier that predicts when each word should be used. \n7. ◑ The dialogue act classifier assigns labels to individual posts, without considering the context in which the post is found. However, dialogue acts are highly dependent on context, and some sequences of dialogue act are much more likely than others. For example, a ynQuestion dialogue act is much more likely to be answered by a yanswer than by a greeting. Make use of this fact to build a consecutive classifier for labeling dialogue acts. Be sure to consider what features might be useful. See the code for the consecutive classifier for part-of-speech tags in Example 6-5 to get some ideas. \n8. ◑ Word features can be very useful for performing document classification, since the words that appear in a document give a strong indication about what its semantic content is. However, many words occur very infrequently, and some of the most informative words in a document may never have occurred in our training data. One solution is to make use of a lexicon, which describes how different words relate to one another. Using the WordNet lexicon, augment the movie review document classifier presented in this chapter to use features that generalize the words that appear in a document, making it more likely that they will match words found in the training data. \n9. $bullet$ The PP Attachment Corpus is a corpus describing prepositional phrase attachment decisions.

Explore this issue by looking at corpus data and writing programs as needed. Consider the following examples: \n(13) a. in the car versus on the train b. in town versus on campus c. in the picture versus on the screen d. in Macbeth versus on Letterman \nExtracting Information from Text \nFor any given question, it’s likely that someone has written the answer down somewhere. The amount of natural language text that is available in electronic form is truly staggering, and is increasing every day. However, the complexity of natural language can make it very difficult to access the information in that text. The state of the art in NLP is still a long way from being able to build general-purpose representations of meaning from unrestricted text. If we instead focus our efforts on a limited set of questions or “entity relations,” such as “where are different facilities located” or “who is employed by what company,” we can make significant progress. The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions: \n1. How can we build a system that extracts structured data from unstructured text?   \n2. What are some robust methods for identifying the entities and relationships described in a text?   \n3. Which corpora are appropriate for this work, and how do we use them for training and evaluating our models? \nAlong the way, we’ll apply techniques from the last two chapters to the problems of chunking and named entity recognition. \n7.1  Information Extraction \nInformation comes in many shapes and sizes. One important form is structured data, where there is a regular and predictable organization of entities and relationships. For example, we might be interested in the relation between companies and locations. Given a particular company, we would like to be able to identify the locations where it does business; conversely, given a location, we would like to discover which companies do business in that location. If our data is in tabular form, such as the example in Table 7-1, then answering these queries is straightforward.",

        "content": "Information Extraction Architecture \nFigure 7-1 shows the architecture for a simple information extraction system. It begins by processing a document using several of the procedures discussed in Chapters 3 and 5: first, the raw text of the document is split into sentences using a sentence segmenter, and each sentence is further subdivided into words using a tokenizer. Next, each sentence is tagged with part-of-speech tags, which will prove very helpful in the next step, named entity recognition. In this step, we search for mentions of potentially interesting entities in each sentence. Finally, we use relation recognition to search for likely relations between different entities in the text. \nTo perform the first three tasks, we can define a function that simply connects together NLTK’s default sentence segmenter $bullet$ , word tokenizer $pmb { theta }$ , and part-of-speech tagger $bullet$ : \n$gg >$ def ie_preprocess(document): sentences $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.sent_tokenize(document) sentences $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [nltk.word_tokenize(sent) for sent in sentences] sentences $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [nltk.pos_tag(sent) for sent in sentences] \nRemember that our program samples assume you begin your interactive session or your program with import nltk, re, pprint. \nNext, in named entity recognition, we segment and label the entities that might participate in interesting relations with one another. Typically, these will be definite noun phrases such as the knights who say “ni”, or proper names such as Monty Python. In some tasks it is useful to also consider indefinite nouns or noun chunks, such as every student or cats, and these do not necessarily refer to entities in the same way as definite NPs and proper names. \nFinally, in relation extraction, we search for specific patterns between pairs of entities that occur near one another in the text, and use those patterns to build tuples recording the relationships between the entities. \n7.2  Chunking \nThe basic technique we will use for entity recognition is chunking, which segments and labels multitoken sequences as illustrated in Figure 7-2. The smaller boxes show the word-level tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, while the large boxes show higher-level chunking. Each of these larger boxes is called a chunk. Like tokenization, which omits whitespace, chunking usually selects a subset of the tokens. Also like tokenization, the pieces produced by a chunker do not overlap in the source text. \nIn this section, we will explore chunking in some depth, beginning with the definition and representation of chunks. We will see regular expression and n-gram approaches to chunking, and will develop and evaluate chunkers using the CoNLL-2000 Chunking Corpus. We will then return in Sections 7.5 and 7.6 to the tasks of named entity recognition and relation extraction. \nNoun Phrase Chunking \nWe will begin by considering the task of noun phrase chunking, or NP-chunking, where we search for chunks corresponding to individual noun phrases.

We will then return in Sections 7.5 and 7.6 to the tasks of named entity recognition and relation extraction. \nNoun Phrase Chunking \nWe will begin by considering the task of noun phrase chunking, or NP-chunking, where we search for chunks corresponding to individual noun phrases. For example, here is some Wall Street Journal text with NP-chunks marked using brackets: \n(2) [ The/DT market/NN ] for/IN [ system-management/NN software/NN ] for/ IN [ Digital/NNP ] [ ’s/POS hardware/NN ] is/VBZ fragmented/JJ enough/RB that/IN [ a/DT giant/NN ] such/JJ as/IN [ Computer/NNP Associates/NNPS ] should/MD do/VB well/RB there/RB ./. \nAs we can see, NP-chunks are often smaller pieces than complete noun phrases. For example, the market for system-management software for Digital’s hardware is a single noun phrase (containing two nested noun phrases), but it is captured in NP-chunks by the simpler chunk the market. One of the motivations for this difference is that NPchunks are defined so as not to contain other NP-chunks. Consequently, any prepositional phrases or subordinate clauses that modify a nominal will not be included in the corresponding NP-chunk, since they almost certainly contain further noun phrases. \nOne of the most useful sources of information for NP-chunking is part-of-speech tags. This is one of the motivations for performing part-of-speech tagging in our information extraction system. We demonstrate this approach using an example sentence that has been part-of-speech tagged in Example 7-1. In order to create an NP-chunker, we will first define a chunk grammar, consisting of rules that indicate how sentences should be chunked. In this case, we will define a simple grammar with a single regular expression rule . This rule says that an NP chunk should be formed whenever the chunker finds an optional determiner (DT) followed by any number of adjectives (JJ) and then a noun (NN). Using this grammar, we create a chunk parser $bullet$ , and test it on our example sentence $bullet$ . The result is a tree, which we can either print $bullet$ , or display graphically $bullet$ . \nExample 7-1. Example of a simple regular expression–based NP chunker. \n>>> sentence $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(\"the\", \"DT\"), (\"little\", \"JJ\"), (\"yellow\", \"JJ\"),   \n... (\"dog\", \"NN\"), (\"barked\", \"VBD\"), (\"at\", \"IN\"),  (\"the\", \"DT\"), (\"cat\", \"NN\")]   \n>>> grammar $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ \"NP: {<DT>?<JJ>*<NN>}\"   \n>>> cp $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.RegexpParser(grammar)   \n>>> result $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ cp.parse(sentence)   \n>>> print result $bullet$   \n(S (NP the/DT little/JJ yellow/JJ dog/NN) barked/VBD at/IN (NP the/DT cat/NN))   \n>>> result.draw() S NP VBD IN NP 一 >   \nDT J j NN barked at DTNN   \n一 一 1 一   \nthe littleyellowdog thecat \n\nTag Patterns \nThe rules that make up a chunk grammar use tag patterns to describe sequences of tagged words. A tag pattern is a sequence of part-of-speech tags delimited using angle brackets, e.g.,<DT>?<JJ>*<NN>. Tag patterns are similar to regular expression patterns (Section 3.4). Now, consider the following noun phrases from the Wall Street Journal: \nanother/DT sharp/JJ dive/NN   \ntrade/NN figures/NNS   \nany/DT new/JJ policy/NN measures/NNS   \nearlier/JJR stages/NNS   \nPanamanian/JJ dictator/NN Manuel/NNP Noriega/NNP \nWe can match these noun phrases using a slight refinement of the first tag pattern above, i.e., $< mathsf { D } mathsf { T } > ref { m a x 2 } 4 . 3 mathsf { T } ldots mathsf { T } ldots mathsf { T } ldots$ . This will chunk any sequence of tokens beginning with an optional determiner, followed by zero or more adjectives of any type (including relative adjectives like earlier/JJR), followed by one or more nouns of any type. However, it is easy to find many more complicated examples which this rule will not cover: \nhis/PRP$ Mansion/NNP House/NNP speech/NN   \nthe/DT price/NN cutting/VBG   \n3/CD %/NN to/TO 4/CD %/NN   \nmore/JJR than/IN 10/CD %/NN   \nthe/DT fastest/JJS developing/VBG trends/NNS   \n's/POS skill/NN \nYour Turn: Try to come up with tag patterns to cover these cases. Test them using the graphical interface nltk.app.chunkparser(). Continue to refine your tag patterns with the help of the feedback given by this tool. \nChunking with Regular Expressions \nTo find the chunk structure for a given sentence, the RegexpParser chunker begins with a flat structure in which no tokens are chunked. The chunking rules are applied in turn, successively updating the chunk structure. Once all of the rules have been invoked, the resulting chunk structure is returned. \nExample 7-2 shows a simple chunk grammar consisting of two rules. The first rule matches an optional determiner or possessive pronoun, zero or more adjectives, then a noun. The second rule matches one or more proper nouns. We also define an example sentence to be chunked $bullet$ , and run the chunker on this input $bullet$ .",

The most widespread file representation uses IOB tags. In this scheme, each token is tagged with one of three special chunk tags, I (inside), O (outside), or B (begin). A token is tagged as B if it marks the beginning of a chunk. Subsequent tokens within the chunk are tagged I. All other tokens are tagged O. The B and I tags are suffixed with the chunk type, e.g., B-NP, INP. Of course, it is not necessary to specify a chunk type for tokens that appear outside a chunk, so these are just labeled O.

The most widespread file representation uses IOB tags. In this scheme, each token is tagged with one of three special chunk tags, I (inside), O (outside), or B (begin). A token is tagged as B if it marks the beginning of a chunk. Subsequent tokens within the chunk are tagged I. All other tokens are tagged O. The B and I tags are suffixed with the chunk type, e.g., B-NP, INP. Of course, it is not necessary to specify a chunk type for tokens that appear outside a chunk, so these are just labeled O. An example of this scheme is shown in Figure 7-3. \nIOB tags have become the standard way to represent chunk structures in files, and we will also be using this format. Here is how the information in Figure 7-3 would appear in a file: \nWe PRP B-NPsaw VBD Othe DT B-NPlittle JJ I-NPyellow JJ I-NPdog NN I-NP\nIn this representation there is one token per line, each with its part-of-speech tag and chunk tag. This format permits us to represent more than one chunk type, so long as the chunks do not overlap. As we saw earlier, chunk structures can also be represented using trees. These have the benefit that each chunk is a constituent that can be manipulated directly. An example is shown in Figure 7-4. \nNLTK uses trees for its internal representation of chunks, but provides methods for converting between such trees and the IOB format. \n7.3  Developing and Evaluating Chunkers \nNow you have a taste of what chunking does, but we haven’t explained how to evaluate chunkers. As usual, this requires a suitably annotated corpus. We begin by looking at the mechanics of converting IOB format into an NLTK tree, then at how this is done on a larger scale using a chunked corpus. We will see how to score the accuracy of a chunker relative to a corpus, then look at some more data-driven ways to search for NP chunks. Our focus throughout will be on expanding the coverage of a chunker. \nReading IOB Format and the CoNLL-2000 Chunking Corpus \nUsing the corpora module we can load Wall Street Journal text that has been tagged then chunked using the IOB notation.

The CoNLL-2000 Chunking Corpus contains $2 7 0 mathrm { k }$ words of Wall Street Journal text, divided into “train” and “test” portions, annotated with part-of-speech tags and chunk tags in the IOB format. We can access the data using nltk.corpus.conll2000. Here is an example that reads the 100th sentence of the “train” portion of the corpus: \n>>> from nltk.corpus import conll2000   \n>>> print conll2000.chunked_sents('train.txt')[99]   \n(S (PP Over/IN) (NP a/DT cup/NN) (PP of/IN) (NP coffee/NN) ,/, (NP Mr./NNP Stone/NNP) (VP told/VBD) (NP his/PRP$ story/NN) ./.) \nAs you can see, the CoNLL-2000 Chunking Corpus contains three chunk types: NP chunks, which we have already seen; VP chunks, such as has already delivered; and PP chunks, such as because of. Since we are only interested in the NP chunks right now, we can use the chunk_types argument to select them: \n\n>>> print conll2000.chunked_sents('train.txt', chunk_types=['NP'])[99]   \n(S Over/IN (NP a/DT cup/NN) of/IN (NP coffee/NN) ,/, (NP Mr./NNP Stone/NNP) told/VBD (NP his/PRP$ story/NN) ./.) \nSimple Evaluation and Baselines \nNow that we can access a chunked corpus, we can evaluate chunkers. We start off by establishing a baseline for the trivial chunk parser cp that creates no chunks: \n>>> from nltk.corpus import conll2000   \n>>> cp $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.RegexpParser(\"\")   \n>>> test_sents $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ conll2000.chunked_sents('test.txt', chunk_types $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['NP'])   \n>>> print cp.evaluate(test_sents)   \nChunkParse score: IOB Accuracy: $4 3 . 4 %$ Precision: $0 . 0 %$ Recall: $0 . 0 %$ F-Measure: $0 . 0 %$ \nThe IOB tag accuracy indicates that more than a third of the words are tagged with O, i.e., not in an NP chunk. However, since our tagger did not find any chunks, its precision, recall, and F-measure are all zero. Now let’s try a naive regular expression chunker that looks for tags beginning with letters that are characteristic of noun phrase tags (e.g., CD, DT, and JJ). \n>>> grammar $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ r\"NP: {<[CDJNP].*>+}\"   \n>>> cp $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.RegexpParser(grammar)   \n>>> print cp.evaluate(test_sents)   \nChunkParse score: IOB Accuracy: $8 7 . 7 %$ Precision: $7 0 . 6 %$ Recall: $6 7 . 8 %$ F-Measure: $6 9 . 2 %$ \nAs you can see, this approach achieves decent results. However, we can improve on it by adopting a more data-driven approach, where we use the training corpus to find the chunk tag (I, O, or B) that is most likely for each part-of-speech tag. In other words, we can build a chunker using a unigram tagger (Section 5.4). But rather than trying to determine the correct part-of-speech tag for each word, we are trying to determine the correct chunk tag, given each word’s part-of-speech tag.",

However, we can improve on it by adopting a more data-driven approach, where we use the training corpus to find the chunk tag (I, O, or B) that is most likely for each part-of-speech tag. In other words, we can build a chunker using a unigram tagger (Section 5.4). But rather than trying to determine the correct part-of-speech tag for each word, we are trying to determine the correct chunk tag, given each word’s part-of-speech tag. \nIn Example 7-4, we define the UnigramChunker class, which uses a unigram tagger to label sentences with chunk tags. Most of the code in this class is simply used to convert back and forth between the chunk tree representation used by NLTK’s ChunkParserI interface, and the IOB representation used by the embedded tagger. The class defines two methods: a constructor $bullet$ , which is called when we build a new UnigramChunker; and the parse method $bullet$ , which is used to chunk new sentences. \nExample 7-4. Noun phrase chunking with a unigram tagger. \nclass UnigramChunker(nltk.ChunkParserI): def __init__(self, train_sents): train_data $bf Pi = bf Pi big [ big [ bf Pi ( t , c )$ for $boldsymbol { mathsf { Pi } } _ { w , mathfrak { t } , mathfrak { c } }$ in nltk.chunk.tree2conlltags(sent)] for sent in train_sents] self.tagger $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.UnigramTagger(train_data) def parse(self, sentence): pos_tags $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [pos for (word,pos) in sentence] tagged_pos_tags $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ self.tagger.tag(pos_tags) chunktags $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [chunktag for (pos, chunktag) in tagged_pos_tags] conlltags $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(word, pos, chunktag) for ((word,pos),chunktag) in zip(sentence, chunktags)] return nltk.chunk.conlltags2tree(conlltags) \nThe constructor $bullet$ expects a list of training sentences, which will be in the form of chunk trees. It first converts training data to a form that’s suitable for training the tagger, using tree2conlltags to map each chunk tree to a list of word,tag,chunk triples. It then uses that converted training data to train a unigram tagger, and stores it in self.tag ger for later use. \nThe parse method $bullet$ takes a tagged sentence as its input, and begins by extracting the part-of-speech tags from that sentence. It then tags the part-of-speech tags with IOB chunk tags, using the tagger self.tagger that was trained in the constructor. Next, it extracts the chunk tags, and combines them with the original sentence, to yield conlltags. Finally, it uses conlltags2tree to convert the result back into a chunk tree. \nNow that we have UnigramChunker, we can train it using the CoNLL-2000 Chunking Corpus, and test its resulting performance: \n>>> test_sents $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ conll2000.chunked_sents('test.txt', chunk_types $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['NP'])   \n>>> train_sents $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ conll2000.chunked_sents('train.txt', chunk_types $ L =$ ['NP'])   \n>>> unigram_chunker $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ UnigramChunker(train_sents)   \n>>> print unigram_chunker.evaluate(test_sents)   \nChunkParse score: IOB Accuracy: $9 2 . 9 %$ Precision: $7 9 . 9 %$ Recall: $8 6 . 8 %$ F-Measure: $8 3 . 2 %$ \nThis chunker does reasonably well, achieving an overall F-measure score of $8 3 %$ . Let’s take a look at what it’s learned, by using its unigram tagger to assign a tag to each of the part-of-speech tags that appear in the corpus: \n>>> postags $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sorted(set(pos for sent in train_sents for (word,pos) in sent.leaves()))   \n>>> print unigram_chunker.tagger.tag(postags)   \n$begin{array} { r l } & { mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { Gamma } ^ { prime } = mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } - mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } - mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } - mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } - mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 7 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 7 } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 7 } ^ { prime } , }  & { mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { Gamma } ^ { prime } = mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { Gamma } ^ { prime } , mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { Gamma } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 0 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 7 } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { ( Gamma Lambda ^ { prime } , ~ 1 ) } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 1 } ^ { prime prime } - mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { Gamma } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { mathrm { L } } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 7 } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 7 } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 7 } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 8 } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { 7 } ^ { prime } , }  &  mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { Gamma } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { mathrm { B } } ^ { prime prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { mathrm { B } } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { mathrm { B } } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { mathrm { B } } ^ { prime } mathrm {  ~ Lambda ~ } _ { mathrm { B } }  end{array}$ \nIt has discovered that most punctuation marks occur outside of NP chunks, with the exception of $#$ and $$ 1$ , both of which are used as currency markers. It has also found that determiners (DT) and possessives $P R P  S$ and $W P S$ ) occur at the beginnings of NP chunks, while noun types (NN, NNP, NNPS, NNS) mostly occur inside of NP chunks. \nHaving built a unigram chunker, it is quite easy to build a bigram chunker: we simply change the class name to BigramChunker, and modify line $pmb { theta }$ in Example 7-4 to construct a BigramTagger rather than a UnigramTagger. The resulting chunker has slightly higher performance than the unigram chunker: \n>>> bigram_chunker $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ BigramChunker(train_sents)   \n>>> print bigram_chunker.evaluate(test_sents)   \nChunkParse score: IOB Accuracy: $9 3 . 3 %$ Precision: $8 2 . 3 %$ Recall: $8 6 . 8 %$ F-Measure: $8 4 . 5 %$ \nTraining Classifier-Based Chunkers \nBoth the regular expression–based chunkers and the n-gram chunkers decide what chunks to create entirely based on part-of-speech tags. However, sometimes part-ofspeech tags are insufficient to determine how a sentence should be chunked. For example, consider the following two statements: \n(3) a. Joey/NN sold/VBD the/DT farmer/NN rice/NN ./. b. Nick/NN broke/VBD my/DT computer/NN monitor/NN ./. \nThese two sentences have the same part-of-speech tags, yet they are chunked differently. In the first sentence, the farmer and rice are separate chunks, while the corresponding material in the second sentence, the computer monitor, is a single chunk. Clearly, we need to make use of information about the content of the words, in addition to just their part-of-speech tags, if we wish to maximize chunking performance. \nOne way that we can incorporate information about the content of words is to use a classifier-based tagger to chunk the sentence. Like the n-gram chunker considered in the previous section, this classifier-based chunker will work by assigning IOB tags to the words in a sentence, and then converting those tags to chunks. For the classifierbased tagger itself, we will use the same approach that we used in Section 6.1 to build a part-of-speech tagger.",

Like the n-gram chunker considered in the previous section, this classifier-based chunker will work by assigning IOB tags to the words in a sentence, and then converting those tags to chunks. For the classifierbased tagger itself, we will use the same approach that we used in Section 6.1 to build a part-of-speech tagger. \n\nThe basic code for the classifier-based NP chunker is shown in Example 7-5. It consists of two classes. The first class $bullet$ is almost identical to the ConsecutivePosTagger class from Example 6-5. The only two differences are that it calls a different feature extractor $pmb { theta }$ and that it uses a MaxentClassifier rather than a NaiveBayesClassifier $bullet$ . The second class $bullet$ is basically a wrapper around the tagger class that turns it into a chunker. During training, this second class maps the chunk trees in the training corpus into tag sequences; in the parse() method, it converts the tag sequence provided by the tagger back into a chunk tree. \nExample 7-5.

We begin by defining a simple feature extractor, which just provides the part-of-speech tag of the current token. Using this feature extractor, our classifier-based chunker is very similar to the unigram chunker, as is reflected in its performance: \n\n$gg >$ def npchunk_features(sentence, i, history): word, pos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sentence[i] return {\"pos\": pos}   \n>>> chunker $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ ConsecutiveNPChunker(train_sents)   \n>>> print chunker.evaluate(test_sents)   \nChunkParse score: IOB Accuracy: $9 2 . 9 %$ Precision: $7 9 . 9 %$ Recall: $8 6 . 7 %$ F-Measure: $8 3 . 2 %$ \nWe can also add a feature for the previous part-of-speech tag. Adding this feature allows the classifier to model interactions between adjacent tags, and results in a chunker that is closely related to the bigram chunker. \n>>> def npchunk_features(sentence, i, history): word, pos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sentence[i] if $mathrm { ~ i ~ } = 0$ : prevword, prevpos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"<START>\", \"<START>\" else: prevword, prevpos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sentence[i-1] return {\"pos\": pos, \"prevpos\": prevpos}   \n>>> chunker $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ConsecutiveNPChunker(train_sents)   \n>>> print chunker.evaluate(test_sents)   \nChunkParse score: IOB Accuracy: $9 3 . 6 %$ Precision: $8 1 . 9 %$ Recall: $8 7 . 1 %$ F-Measure: $8 4 . 4 %$ \nNext, we’ll try adding a feature for the current word, since we hypothesized that word content should be useful for chunking. We find that this feature does indeed improve the chunker’s performance, by about 1.5 percentage points (which corresponds to about a $10 %$ reduction in the error rate). \n$gg >$ def npchunk_features(sentence, i, history): word, pos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sentence[i] if $mathrm { ~ i ~ } = 0$ : prevword, prevpos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"<START>\", \"<START>\" else: prevword, prevpos $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ sentence[i-1] return {\"pos\": pos, \"word\": word, \"prevpos\": prevpos}   \n>>> chunker $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ConsecutiveNPChunker(train_sents)   \n$gg >$ print chunker.evaluate(test_sents)   \nChunkParse score: IOB Accuracy: $9 4 . 2 %$ Precision: $8 3 . 4 %$ Recall: $8 8 . 6 %$ F-Measure: $8 5 . 9 %$ \nFinally, we can try extending the feature extractor with a variety of additional features, such as lookahead features $bullet$ , paired features $pmb { theta }$ , and complex contextual features $bullet$ .

Trees consist of tagged tokens, optionally grouped under a chunk node such as NP. However, it is possible to build chunk structures of arbitrary depth, simply by creating a multistage chunk grammar containing recursive rules. Example 7-6 has patterns for noun phrases, prepositional phrases, verb phrases, and sentences. This is a four-stage chunk grammar, and can be used to create structures having a depth of at most four. \n\nExample 7-6.

It has other shortcomings, too.   \nLet’s see what happens when we apply this chunker to a sentence having deeper nesting.   \nNotice that it fails to identify the VP chunk starting at $bullet$ .   \n>>> sentence $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [(\"John\", \"NNP\"), (\"thinks\", \"VBZ\"), (\"Mary\", \"NN\"), (\"saw\", \"VBD\"), (\"the\", \"DT\"), (\"cat\", \"NN\"), (\"sit\", \"VB\"), (\"on\", \"IN\"), (\"the\", \"DT\"), (\"mat\", \"NN\")]   \n>>> print cp.parse(sentence)   \n(S (NP John/NNP) thinks/VBZ (NP Mary/NN) saw/VBD (CLAUSE (NP the/DT cat/NN) (VP sit/VB (PP on/IN (NP the/DT mat/NN))))) \n\nThe solution to these problems is to get the chunker to loop over its patterns: after trying all of them, it repeats the process. We add an optional second argument loop to specify the number of times the set of patterns should be run: \n>>> cp $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.RegexpParser(grammar, loop $^ { = 2 }$ )   \n>>> print cp.parse(sentence)   \n(S (NP John/NNP) thinks/VBZ (CLAUSE (NP Mary/NN) (VP saw/VBD (CLAUSE \n(NP the/DT cat/NN) (VP sit/VB (PP on/IN (NP the/DT mat/NN))))))) \nThis cascading process enables us to create deep structures. However, creating and debugging a cascade is difficult, and there comes a point where it is more effective to do full parsing (see Chapter 8). Also, the cascading process can only produce trees of fixed depth (no deeper than the number of stages in the cascade), and this is insufficient for complete syntactic analysis. \nTrees \nA tree is a set of connected labeled nodes, each reachable by a unique path from a distinguished root node.

For example, in Question Answering (QA), we try to improve the precision of Information Retrieval by recovering not whole pages, but just those parts which contain an answer to the user’s question. Most QA systems take the documents returned by standard Information Retrieval, and then attempt to isolate the minimal text snippet in the document containing the answer. Now suppose the question was Who was the first President of the US?, and one of the documents that was retrieved contained the following passage: \n\n(5) The Washington Monument is the most prominent structure in Washington, D.C. and one of the city’s early attractions. It was built in honor of George Washington, who led the country to independence and then became its first President. \nAnalysis of the question leads us to expect that an answer should be of the form $X$ was the first President of the US, where $X$ is not only a noun phrase, but also refers to a named entity of type PER. This should allow us to ignore the first sentence in the passage. Although it contains two occurrences of Washington, named entity recognition should tell us that neither of them has the correct type. \nHow do we go about identifying named entities? One option would be to look up each word in an appropriate list of names. For example, in the case of locations, we could use a gazetteer, or geographical dictionary, such as the Alexandria Gazetteer or the Getty Gazetteer. However, doing this blindly runs into problems, as shown in Figure 7-5. \nKEEP UP ONYOUR READING WITHAUDIO BOOKS Vietnam UK Louisiana, US Audio books are highly popular with library patrons in the town S.Carolina, USA of Springfield, Greene County, MO. \"People are mobile Maine,USA Alabama,U and busier,and audio books fit into that lifestyle\"says Gary Louisiana, USA Indiana, USA Sanchez, who oversees the library's $2 million budget... Dominican Republic Kentucky, USA \nObserve that the gazetteer has good coverage of locations in many countries, and incorrectly finds locations like Sanchez in the Dominican Republic and On in Vietnam. Of course we could omit such locations from the gazetteer, but then we won’t be able to identify them when they do appear in a document. \nIt gets even harder in the case of names for people or organizations. Any list of such names will probably have poor coverage. New organizations come into existence every day, so if we are trying to deal with contemporary newswire or blog entries, it is unlikely that we will be able to recognize many of the entities using gazetteer lookup. \n\nAnother major source of difficulty is caused by the fact that many named entity terms are ambiguous. Thus May and North are likely to be parts of named entities for DATE and LOCATION, respectively, but could both be part of a PERSON; conversely Christian Dior looks like a PERSON but is more likely to be of type ORGANIZATION. A term like Yankee will be an ordinary modifier in some contexts, but will be marked as an entity of type ORGANIZATION in the phrase Yankee infielders. \nFurther challenges are posed by multiword names like Stanford University, and by names that contain other names, such as Cecil H. Green Library and Escondido Village Conference Service Center. In named entity recognition, therefore, we need to be able to identify the beginning and end of multitoken sequences. \nNamed entity recognition is a task that is well suited to the type of classifier-based approach that we saw for noun phrase chunking. In particular, we can build a tagger that labels each word in a sentence using the IOB format, where chunks are labeled by their appropriate type. Here is part of the CONLL 2002 (conll2002) Dutch training data: \nEddy N B-PER   \nBonte N I-PER   \nis V O   \nwoordvoerder N O   \nvan Prep O   \ndiezelfde Pron O   \nHogeschool N B-ORG   \n. Punc O \nIn this representation, there is one token per line, each with its part-of-speech tag and its named entity tag. Based on this training corpus, we can construct a tagger that can be used to label new sentences, and use the nltk.chunk.conlltags2tree() function to convert the tag sequences into a chunk tree. \nNLTK provides a classifier that has already been trained to recognize named entities, accessed with the function nltk.ne_chunk(). If we set the parameter binary $ c =$ True $bullet$ , then named entities are just tagged as NE; otherwise, the classifier adds category labels such as PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and GPE. \n>>> sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.treebank.tagged_sents()[22]   \n>>> print nltk.ne_chunk(sent, binary $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ True)   \n(S The/DT (NE U.S./NNP) is/VBZ one/CD according/VBG to/TO (NE Brooke/NNP T./NNP Mossman/NNP)   \n>>> print nltk.ne_chunk(sent)   \n(S The/DT (GPE U.S./NNP) is/VBZ one/CD according/VBG to/TO (PERSON Brooke/NNP T./NNP Mossman/NNP) \n\n7.6  Relation Extraction \nOnce named entities have been identified in a text, we then want to extract the relations that exist between them. As indicated earlier, we will typically be looking for relations between specified types of named entity. One way of approaching this task is to initially look for all triples of the form $( X , { mathfrak { a } } , Y )$ , where $X$ and Y are named entities of the required types, and α is the string of words that intervenes between $X$ and Y. We can then use regular expressions to pull out just those instances of $mathtt { a }$ that express the relation that we are looking for. The following example searches for strings that contain the word in. The special regular expression $( ? ! backslash b . { + } mathrm { i n g } backslash b )$ is a negative lookahead assertion that allows us to disregard strings such as success in supervising the transition of, where in is followed by a gerund. \n>>> IN $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ re.compile(r'.*binb(?!b.+ing)')   \n>>> for doc in nltk.corpus.ieer.parsed_docs('NYT_19980315'): for rel in nltk.sem.extract_rels('ORG', 'LOC', doc, corpus $ c =$ 'ieer', pattern $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ IN): print nltk.sem.show_raw_rtuple(rel)   \n[ORG: 'WHYY'] 'in' [LOC: 'Philadelphia']   \n[ORG: 'McGlashan &AMP; Sarrail'] 'firm in' [LOC: 'San Mateo']   \n[ORG: 'Freedom Forum'] 'in' [LOC: 'Arlington']   \n[ORG: 'Brookings Institution'] ', the research group in' [LOC: 'Washington']   \n[ORG: 'Idealab'] ', a self-described business incubator based in' [LOC: 'Los Angeles']   \n[ORG: 'Open Text'] ', based in' [LOC: 'Waterloo']   \n[ORG: 'WGBH'] 'in' [LOC: 'Boston']   \n[ORG: 'Bastille Opera'] 'in' [LOC: 'Paris']   \n[ORG: 'Omnicom'] 'in' [LOC: 'New York']   \n[ORG: 'DDB Needham'] 'in' [LOC: 'New York']   \n[ORG: 'Kaplan Thaler Group'] 'in' [LOC: 'New York']   \n[ORG: 'BBDO South'] 'in' [LOC: 'Atlanta']   \n[ORG: 'Georgia-Pacific'] 'in' [LOC: 'Atlanta'] \nSearching for the keyword in works reasonably well, though it will also retrieve false positives such as [ORG: House Transportation Committee] , secured the most money in the [LOC: New York]; there is unlikely to be a simple string-based method of excluding filler strings such as this.",

The special regular expression $( ? ! backslash b . { + } mathrm { i n g } backslash b )$ is a negative lookahead assertion that allows us to disregard strings such as success in supervising the transition of, where in is followed by a gerund. \n>>> IN $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ re.compile(r'.*binb(?!b.+ing)')   \n>>> for doc in nltk.corpus.ieer.parsed_docs('NYT_19980315'): for rel in nltk.sem.extract_rels('ORG', 'LOC', doc, corpus $ c =$ 'ieer', pattern $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ IN): print nltk.sem.show_raw_rtuple(rel)   \n[ORG: 'WHYY'] 'in' [LOC: 'Philadelphia']   \n[ORG: 'McGlashan &AMP; Sarrail'] 'firm in' [LOC: 'San Mateo']   \n[ORG: 'Freedom Forum'] 'in' [LOC: 'Arlington']   \n[ORG: 'Brookings Institution'] ', the research group in' [LOC: 'Washington']   \n[ORG: 'Idealab'] ', a self-described business incubator based in' [LOC: 'Los Angeles']   \n[ORG: 'Open Text'] ', based in' [LOC: 'Waterloo']   \n[ORG: 'WGBH'] 'in' [LOC: 'Boston']   \n[ORG: 'Bastille Opera'] 'in' [LOC: 'Paris']   \n[ORG: 'Omnicom'] 'in' [LOC: 'New York']   \n[ORG: 'DDB Needham'] 'in' [LOC: 'New York']   \n[ORG: 'Kaplan Thaler Group'] 'in' [LOC: 'New York']   \n[ORG: 'BBDO South'] 'in' [LOC: 'Atlanta']   \n[ORG: 'Georgia-Pacific'] 'in' [LOC: 'Atlanta'] \nSearching for the keyword in works reasonably well, though it will also retrieve false positives such as [ORG: House Transportation Committee] , secured the most money in the [LOC: New York]; there is unlikely to be a simple string-based method of excluding filler strings such as this. \nAs shown earlier, the Dutch section of the CoNLL 2002 Named Entity Corpus contains not just named entity annotation, but also part-of-speech tags.

Why are three tags necessary? What problem would be caused if we used I and O tags exclusively? \n2. ○ Write a tag pattern to match noun phrases containing plural head nouns, e.g., many/JJ researchers/NNS, two/CD weeks/NNS, both/DT new/JJ positions/NNS. Try to do this by generalizing the tag pattern that handled singular noun phrases. \n3. ○ Pick one of the three chunk types in the CoNLL-2000 Chunking Corpus. Inspect the data and try to observe any patterns in the POS tag sequences that make up this kind of chunk. Develop a simple chunker using the regular expression chunker nltk.RegexpParser. Discuss any tag sequences that are difficult to chunk reliably. \n4. ○ An early definition of chunk was the material that occurs between chinks. Develop a chunker that starts by putting the whole sentence in a single chunk, and then does the rest of its work solely by chinking. Determine which tags (or tag sequences) are most likely to make up chinks with the help of your own utility program. Compare the performance and simplicity of this approach relative to a chunker based entirely on chunk rules. \n5. ◑ Write a tag pattern to cover noun phrases that contain gerunds, e.g., the/DT receiving/VBG end/NN, assistant/NN managing/VBG editor/NN. Add these patterns to the grammar, one per line. Test your work using some tagged sentences of your own devising. \n6. ◑ Write one or more tag patterns to handle coordinated noun phrases, e.g., July/ NNP and/CC August/NNP, all/DT your/ $P R P  S$ managers/NNS and/CC supervisors/NNS, company/NN courts/NNS and/CC adjudicators/NNS. \n7. ◑ Carry out the following evaluation tasks for any of the chunkers you have developed earlier. (Note that most chunking corpora contain some internal inconsistencies, such that any reasonable rule-based approach will produce errors.) \na. Evaluate your chunker on 100 sentences from a chunked corpus, and report the precision, recall, and F-measure.   \nb. Use the chunkscore.missed() and chunkscore.incorrect() methods to identify the errors made by your chunker. Discuss.   \nc. Compare the performance of your chunker to the baseline chunker discussed in the evaluation section of this chapter. \n8. ◑ Develop a chunker for one of the chunk types in the CoNLL Chunking Corpus using a regular expression–based chunk grammar RegexpChunk. Use any combination of rules for chunking, chinking, merging, or splitting. \n9. ◑ Sometimes a word is incorrectly tagged, e.g., the head noun in 12/CD or/CC so/ RB cases/VBZ. Instead of requiring manual correction of tagger output, good chunkers are able to work with the erroneous output of taggers. Look for other examples of correctly chunked noun phrases with incorrect tags. \n10. $mathbf { 0 }$ The bigram chunker scores about $90 %$ accuracy. Study its errors and try to work out why it doesn’t get $100 %$ accuracy. Experiment with trigram chunking. Are you able to improve the performance any more? \n11. $bullet$ Apply the n-gram and Brill tagging methods to IOB chunk tagging. Instead of assigning POS tags to words, here we will assign IOB tags to the POS tags. E.g., if the tag DT (determiner) often occurs at the start of a chunk, it will be tagged B (begin). Evaluate the performance of these chunking methods relative to the regular expression chunking methods covered in this chapter.   \n12. ● We saw in Chapter 5 that it is possible to establish an upper limit to tagging performance by looking for ambiguous n-grams, which are n-grams that are tagged in more than one possible way in the training data. Apply the same method to determine an upper bound on the performance of an n-gram chunker.   \n13. $bullet$ Pick one of the three chunk types in the CoNLL Chunking Corpus. Write functions to do the following tasks for your chosen type: a. List all the tag sequences that occur with each instance of this chunk type. b. Count the frequency of each tag sequence, and produce a ranked list in order of decreasing frequency; each line should consist of an integer (the frequency) and the tag sequence. c. Inspect the high-frequency tag sequences. Use these as the basis for developing a better chunker.   \n14. $bullet$ The baseline chunker presented in the evaluation section tends to create larger chunks than it should. For example, the phrase [every/DT time/NN] [she/PRP] sees/VBZ [a/DT newspaper/NN] contains two consecutive chunks, and our baseline chunker will incorrectly combine the first two: [every/DT time/NN she/PRP]. Write a program that finds which of these chunk-internal tags typically occur at the start of a chunk, then devise one or more rules that will split up these chunks. Combine these with the existing baseline chunker and re-evaluate it, to see if you have discovered an improved baseline.   \n15. $bullet$ Develop an NP chunker that converts POS tagged text into a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a verb followed by a sequence of noun phrases and prepositions, e.g., the little cat sat on the mat becomes ('sat', 'on', 'NP')...   \n16. $bullet$ The Penn Treebank Corpus sample contains a section of tagged Wall Street Journal text that has been chunked into noun phrases. The format uses square brackets, and we have encountered it several times in this chapter. The corpus can be accessed using: for sent in nltk.corpus.treebank_chunk.chunked_sents(fil eid). These are flat trees, just as we got using nltk.cor pus.conll2000.chunked_sents(). a. The functions nltk.tree.pprint() and nltk.chunk.tree2conllstr() can be used to create Treebank and IOB strings from a tree. Write functions chunk2brackets() and chunk2iob() that take a single chunk tree as their sole argument, and return the required multiline string representation. b. Write command-line conversion utilities bracket2iob.py and iob2bracket.py that take a file in Treebank or CoNLL format (respectively) and convert it to the other format. (Obtain some raw Treebank or CoNLL data from the NLTK \n\nCorpora, save it to a file, and then use for line in open(filename) to access it from Python.) \n17. $bullet$ An n-gram chunker can use information other than the current part-of-speech tag and the $n$ -1 previous chunk tags. Investigate other models of the context, such as the n-1 previous part-of-speech tags, or some combination of previous chunk tags along with previous and following part-of-speech tags.   \n18. $bullet$ Consider the way an n-gram tagger uses recent tags to inform its tagging choice. Now observe how a chunker may reuse this sequence information. For example, both tasks will make use of the information that nouns tend to follow adjectives (in English). It would appear that the same information is being maintained in two places. Is this likely to become a problem as the size of the rule sets grows? If so, speculate about any ways that this problem might be addressed. \nAnalyzing Sentence Structure \nEarlier chapters focused on words: how to identify them, analyze their structure, assign them to lexical categories, and access their meanings. We have also seen how to identify patterns in word sequences or n-grams. However, these methods only scratch the surface of the complex constraints that govern sentences. We need a way to deal with the ambiguity that natural language is famous for. We also need to be able to cope with the fact that there are an unlimited number of possible sentences, and we can only write finite programs to analyze their structures and discover their meanings. \nThe goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions: \n1. How can we use a formal grammar to describe the structure of an unlimited set of sentences? 2. How do we represent the structure of sentences using syntax trees? 3. How do parsers analyze a sentence and automatically build a syntax tree? \nAlong the way, we will cover the fundamentals of English syntax, and see that there are systematic aspects of meaning that are much easier to capture once we have identified the structure of sentences.",

        "content": "8.1  Some Grammatical Dilemmas \nLinguistic Data and Unlimited Possibilities \nPrevious chapters have shown you how to process and analyze text corpora, and we have stressed the challenges for NLP in dealing with the vast amount of electronic language data that is growing daily. Let’s consider this data more closely, and make the thought experiment that we have a gigantic corpus consisting of everything that has been either uttered or written in English over, say, the last 50 years. Would we be justified in calling this corpus “the language of modern English”? There are a number of reasons why we might answer no. Recall that in Chapter 3, we asked you to search the Web for instances of the pattern the of. Although it is easy to find examples on the Web containing this word sequence, such as New man at the of IMG  (see http://www .telegraph.co.uk/sport/2387900/New-man-at-the-of-IMG.html), speakers of English will say that most such examples are errors, and therefore not part of English after all. \nAccordingly, we can argue that “modern English” is not equivalent to the very big set of word sequences in our imaginary corpus. Speakers of English can make judgments about these sequences, and will reject some of them as being ungrammatical. \nEqually, it is easy to compose a new sentence and have speakers agree that it is perfectly good English. For example, sentences have an interesting property that they can be embedded inside larger sentences. Consider the following sentences: \n(1) a. Usain Bolt broke the $1 0 0 mathrm { m }$ record. b. The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the $1 0 0 mathrm { m }$ record. c. Andre said The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the $1 0 0 mathrm { m }$ record. d. I think Andre said the Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the $1 0 0 mathrm { m }$ record. \nIf we replaced whole sentences with the symbol S, we would see patterns like Andre said S and I think S. These are templates for taking a sentence and constructing a bigger sentence. There are other templates we can use, such as S but S and S when S. With a bit of ingenuity we can construct some really long sentences using these templates. Here’s an impressive example from a Winnie the Pooh story by A.A. Milne, In Which Piglet Is Entirely Surrounded by Water: \n[You can imagine Piglet’s joy when at last the ship came in sight of him.] In after-years he liked to think that he had been in Very Great Danger during the Terrible Flood, but the only danger he had really been in was the last half-hour of his imprisonment, when Owl, who had just flown up, sat on a branch of his tree to comfort him, and told him a very long story about an aunt who had once laid a seagull’s egg by mistake, and the story went on and on, rather like this sentence, until Piglet who was listening out of his window without much hope, went to sleep quietly and naturally, slipping slowly out of the window towards the water until he was only hanging on by his toes, at which moment, luckily, a sudden loud squawk from Owl, which was really part of the story, being what his aunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave him time to jerk himself back into safety and say, “How interesting, and did she?” when—well, you can imagine his joy when at last he saw the good ship, Brain of Pooh (Captain, C. Robin; 1st Mate, P. Bear) coming over the sea to rescue him… \n\nThis long sentence actually has a simple structure that begins S but S when S. We can see from this example that language provides us with constructions which seem to allow us to extend sentences indefinitely. It is also striking that we can understand sentences of arbitrary length that we’ve never heard before: it’s not hard to concoct an entirely novel sentence, one that has probably never been used before in the history of the language, yet all speakers of the language will understand it. \nThe purpose of a grammar is to give an explicit description of a language. But the way in which we think of a grammar is closely intertwined with what we consider to be a language. Is it a large but finite set of observed utterances and written texts? Is it something more abstract like the implicit knowledge that competent speakers have about grammatical sentences? Or is it some combination of the two? We won’t take a stand on this issue, but instead will introduce the main approaches. \nIn this chapter, we will adopt the formal framework of “generative grammar,” in which a “language” is considered to be nothing more than an enormous collection of all grammatical sentences, and a grammar is a formal notation that can be used for “generating” the members of this set. Grammars use recursive productions of the form $S to { mathsf { S } }$ and S, as we will explore in Section 8.3. In Chapter 10 we will extend this, to automatically build up the meaning of a sentence out of the meanings of its parts. \nUbiquitous Ambiguity \nA well-known example of ambiguity is shown in (2), from the Groucho Marx movie, Animal Crackers (1930): \n(2) While hunting in Africa, I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How an elephant got into my pajamas I’ll never know. \nLet’s take a closer look at the ambiguity in the phrase: I shot an elephant in my pajamas. First we need to define a simple grammar: \n>>> groucho_grammar $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.parse_cfg(\"\"\" S -> NP VP . PP -> P NP NP -> Det N | Det N PP | 'I' VP -> V NP | VP PP Det -> 'an' | 'my' N -> 'elephant' | 'pajamas' V -> 'shot' P -> 'in' \"\"\")",

PP -> P NP NP -> Det N | Det N PP | 'I' VP -> V NP | VP PP Det -> 'an' | 'my' N -> 'elephant' | 'pajamas' V -> 'shot' P -> 'in' \"\"\") \nThis grammar permits the sentence to be analyzed in two ways, depending on whether the prepositional phrase in my pajamas describes the elephant or the shooting event. \n$gg >$ sent $mathbf { Omega } = mathbf { Omega } [ mathbf { Omega } ^ { prime } mathbf { I } ^ { prime }$ , 'shot', 'an', 'elephant', 'in', 'my', 'pajamas']   \n>>> parser $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ChartParser(groucho_grammar)   \n$gg >$ trees $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ parser.nbest_parse(sent)   \n$gg >$ for tree in trees: print tree   \n(S (NP I) (VP (V shot) (NP (Det an) (N elephant) (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas))))))   \n(S (NP I) (VP (VP (V shot) (NP (Det an) (N elephant))) (PP (P in) (NP (Det my) (N pajamas))))) \nThe program produces two bracketed structures, which we can depict as trees, as shown in (3): \nNotice that there’s no ambiguity concerning the meaning of any of the words; e.g., the word shot doesn’t refer to the act of using a gun in the first sentence and using a camera in the second sentence. \nYour Turn: Consider the following sentences and see if you can think of two quite different interpretations: Fighting animals could be dangerous. Visiting relatives can be tiresome. Is ambiguity of the individual words to blame? If not, what is the cause of the ambiguity? \nThis chapter presents grammars and parsing, as the formal and computational methods for investigating and modeling the linguistic phenomena we have been discussing. As we shall see, patterns of well-formedness and ill-formedness in a sequence of words can be understood with respect to the phrase structure and dependencies.

Let’s take a closer look at the sequence the worst part and clumsy looking. This looks like a coordinate structure, where two phrases are joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or or. Here’s an informal (and simplified) statement of how coordination works syntactically: \nCoordinate Structure: if $nu _ { 1 }$ and $nu _ { 2 }$ are both phrases of grammatical category $X$ , then $nu _ { 1 }$ and $nu _ { 2 }$ is also a phrase of category $X$ . \nHere are a couple of examples. In the first, two NPs (noun phrases) have been conjoined to make an NP, while in the second, two APs (adjective phrases) have been conjoined to make an AP. \n(5) a. The book’s ending was (NP the worst part and the best part) for me. b. On land they are (AP slow and clumsy looking). \nWhat we can’t do is conjoin an NP and an AP, which is why the worst part and clumsy looking is ungrammatical. Before we can formalize these ideas, we need to understand the concept of constituent structure. \nConstituent structure is based on the observation that words combine with other words to form units. The evidence that a sequence of words forms such a unit is given by substitutability—that is, a sequence of words in a well-formed sentence can be replaced by a shorter sequence without rendering the sentence ill-formed. To clarify this idea, consider the following sentence: \n(6) The little bear saw the fine fat trout in the brook. \nThe fact that we can substitute He for The little bear indicates that the latter sequence is a unit. By contrast, we cannot replace little bear saw in the same way. (We use an asterisk at the start of a sentence to indicate that it is ungrammatical.) \n(7) a. He saw the fine fat trout in the brook. b. *The he the fine fat trout in the brook. \nIn Figure 8-1, we systematically substitute longer sequences by shorter ones in a way which preserves grammaticality. Each sequence that forms a unit can in fact be replaced by a single word, and we end up with just two elements. \nIn Figure 8-2, we have added grammatical category labels to the words we saw in the earlier figure. The labels NP, VP, and PP stand for noun phrase, verb phrase, and prepositional phrase, respectively. \nIf we now strip out the words apart from the topmost row, add an S node, and flip the figure over, we end up with a standard phrase structure tree, shown in (8). Each node in this tree (including the words) is called a constituent. The immediate constituents of S are NP and VP. \nAs we saw in Section 8.1, sentences can have arbitrary length. Consequently, phrase structure trees can have arbitrary depth. The cascaded chunk parsers we saw in Section 7.4 can only produce structures of bounded depth, so chunking methods aren’t applicable here. \nAs we will see in the next section, a grammar specifies how the sentence can be subdivided into its immediate constituents, and how these can be further subdivided until we reach the level of individual words. \n8.3  Context-Free Grammar \nA Simple Grammar \nLet’s start off by looking at a simple context-free grammar (CFG). By convention, the lefthand side of the first production is the start-symbol of the grammar, typically S, and all well-formed trees must have this symbol as their root label. In NLTK, contextfree grammars are defined in the nltk.grammar module. In Example 8-1 we define a grammar and show how to parse a simple sentence admitted by the grammar. \nExample 8-1. A simple context-free grammar. \ngrammar1 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.parse_cfg(\"\"\" S -> NP VP VP -> V NP | V NP PP PP -> P NP V -> \"saw\" \"ate\" | \"walked\" NP -> \"John\" | \"Mary\" | \"Bob\" | Det N | Det N PP Det -> \"a\" \"an\" | \"the\" | \"my\" N -> \"man\" \"dog\" | \"cat\" | \"telescope\" | \"park\" P -> \"in\" \"on\" | \"by\" | \"with\" \"\"\")   \n>>> sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"Mary saw Bob\".split()   \n>>> rd_parser $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1)   \n>>> for tree in rd_parser.nbest_parse(sent): print tree   \n(S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP Bob))) \nThe grammar in Example 8-1 contains productions involving various syntactic categories, as laid out in Table 8-1. The recursive descent parser used here can also be inspected via a graphical interface, as illustrated in Figure 8-3; we discuss this parser in more detail in Section 8.4.",

The ambiguity in question is called a prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity, as we saw earlier in this chapter. As you may recall, it is an ambiguity about attachment since the PP in the park needs to be attached to one of two places in the tree: either as a child of VP or else as a child of NP. When the PP is attached to VP, the intended interpretation is that the seeing event happened in the park. \nHowever, if the PP is attached to NP, then it was the man who was in the park, and the agent of the seeing (the dog) might have been sitting on the balcony of an apartment overlooking the park. \nWriting Your Own Grammars \nIf you are interested in experimenting with writing CFGs, you will find it helpful to create and edit your grammar in a text file, say, mygrammar.cfg. You can then load it into NLTK and parse with it as follows: \n>>> grammar1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.data.load('file:mygrammar.cfg')   \n>>> sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"Mary saw Bob\".split()   \n>>> rd_parser $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1)   \n>>> for tree in rd_parser.nbest_parse(sent): print tree \nMake sure that you put a .cfg suffix on the filename, and that there are no spaces in the string 'file:mygrammar.cfg'.

A grammar is a declarative specification of well-formedness—it is actually just a string, not a program. A parser is a procedural interpretation of the grammar. It searches through the space of trees licensed by a grammar to find one that has the required sentence along its fringe.",

        "content": "A parser permits a grammar to be evaluated against a collection of test sentences, helping linguists to discover mistakes in their grammatical analysis. A parser can serve as a model of psycholinguistic processing, helping to explain the difficulties that humans have with processing certain syntactic constructions. Many natural language applications involve parsing at some point; for example, we would expect the natural language questions submitted to a question-answering system to undergo parsing as an initial step. \nIn this section, we see two simple parsing algorithms, a top-down method called recursive descent parsing, and a bottom-up method called shift-reduce parsing. We also see some more sophisticated algorithms, a top-down method with bottom-up filtering called left-corner parsing, and a dynamic programming technique called chart parsing. \nRecursive Descent Parsing \nThe simplest kind of parser interprets a grammar as a specification of how to break a high-level goal into several lower-level subgoals. The top-level goal is to find an S. The $S to { mathsf { N P } }$ VP production permits the parser to replace this goal with two subgoals: find an NP, then find a VP. Each of these subgoals can be replaced in turn by sub-subgoals, using productions that have NP and VP on their lefthand side. Eventually, this expansion process leads to subgoals such as: find the word telescope. Such subgoals can be directly compared against the input sequence, and succeed if the next word is matched. If there is no match, the parser must back up and try a different alternative. \nThe recursive descent parser builds a parse tree during this process. With the initial goal (find an S), the S root node is created. As the process recursively expands its goals using the productions of the grammar, the parse tree is extended downwards (hence the name recursive descent). We can see this in action using the graphical demonstration nltk.app.rdparser(). Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown in Figure 8-4. \nDuring this process, the parser is often forced to choose between several possible productions. For example, in going from step 3 to step 4, it tries to find productions with N on the lefthand side. The first of these is $ N  m a n$ . When this does not work it backtracks, and tries other N productions in order, until it gets to $mathsf { N } to d o g$ , which matches the next word in the input sentence. Much later, as shown in step 5, it finds a complete parse. This is a tree that covers the entire sentence, without any dangling edges. Once a parse has been found, we can get the parser to look for additional parses. Again it will backtrack and explore other choices of production in case any of them result in a parse. \nNLTK provides a recursive descent parser: \n>>> rd_parser $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar1) >>> sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Mary saw a dog'.split() >>> for t in rd_parser.nbest_parse(sent): print t (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP (Det a) (N dog)))) \nRecursiveDescentParser() takes an optional parameter trace. If trace is greater than zero, then the parser will report the steps that it takes as it parses a text. \nRecursive descent parsing has three key shortcomings. First, left-recursive productions like NP -> NP PP send it into an infinite loop. Second, the parser wastes a lot of time considering words and structures that do not correspond to the input sentence. Third, the backtracking process may discard parsed constituents that will need to be rebuilt again later. For example, backtracking over VP $- > v$ NP will discard the subtree created for the NP. If the parser then proceeds with VP $- > mathsf { V }$ NP PP, then the NP subtree must be created all over again. \nRecursive descent parsing is a kind of top-down parsing. Top-down parsers use a grammar to predict what the input will be, before inspecting the input! However, since the input is available to the parser all along, it would be more sensible to consider the input sentence from the very beginning. This approach is called bottom-up parsing, and we will see an example in the next section. \nShift-Reduce Parsing \nA simple kind of bottom-up parser is the shift-reduce parser. In common with all bottom-up parsers, a shift-reduce parser tries to find sequences of words and phrases that correspond to the righthand side of a grammar production, and replace them with the lefthand side, until the whole sentence is reduced to an S.",

In common with all bottom-up parsers, a shift-reduce parser tries to find sequences of words and phrases that correspond to the righthand side of a grammar production, and replace them with the lefthand side, until the whole sentence is reduced to an S. \nThe shift-reduce parser repeatedly pushes the next input word onto a stack (Section 4.1); this is the shift operation. If the top $n$ items on the stack match the $n$ items on the righthand side of some production, then they are all popped off the stack, and the item on the lefthand side of the production is pushed onto the stack. This replacement of the top $n$ items with a single item is the reduce operation. The operation may be applied only to the top of the stack; reducing items lower in the stack must be done before later items are pushed onto the stack. The parser finishes when all the input is consumed and there is only one item remaining on the stack, a parse tree with an S node as its root. The shift-reduce parser builds a parse tree during the above process. Each time it pops $n$ items off the stack, it combines them into a partial parse tree, and pushes this back onto the stack. We can see the shift-reduce parsing algorithm in action using the graphical demonstration nltk.app.srparser(). Six stages of the execution of this parser are shown in Figure 8-5. \nNLTK provides ShiftReduceParser(), a simple implementation of a shift-reduce parser. This parser does not implement any backtracking, so it is not guaranteed to find a parse for a text, even if one exists. Furthermore, it will only find at most one parse, even if more parses exist. We can provide an optional trace parameter that controls how verbosely the parser reports the steps that it takes as it parses a text: \n>>> sr_parse $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ShiftReduceParser(grammar1) >>> sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Mary saw a dog'.split() >>> print sr_parse.parse(sent) (S (NP Mary) (VP (V saw) (NP (Det a) (N dog)))) \nYour Turn: Run this parser in tracing mode to see the sequence of shift and reduce operations, using sr_parse $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ShiftReduceParser(gram mar1, trace $^ { = 2 }$ ). \nA shift-reduce parser can reach a dead end and fail to find any parse, even if the input sentence is well-formed according to the grammar. When this happens, no input remains, and the stack contains items that cannot be reduced to an S. The problem arises because there are choices made earlier that cannot be undone by the parser (although users of the graphical demonstration can undo their choices). There are two kinds of choices to be made by the parser: (a) which reduction to do when more than one is possible and (b) whether to shift or reduce when either action is possible. \nA shift-reduce parser may be extended to implement policies for resolving such conflicts. For example, it may address shift-reduce conflicts by shifting only when no reductions are possible, and it may address reduce-reduce conflicts by favoring the reduction operation that removes the most items from the stack. (A generalization of the shift-reduce parser, a “lookahead LR parser,” is commonly used in programming language compilers.) \nThe advantages of shift-reduce parsers over recursive descent parsers is that they only build structure that corresponds to the words in the input. Furthermore, they only build each substructure once; e.g., NP(Det(the), N(man)) is only built and pushed onto the stack a single time, regardless of whether it will later be used by the VP -> V NP PP reduction or the NP -> NP PP reduction. \nThe Left-Corner Parser \nOne of the problems with the recursive descent parser is that it goes into an infinite loop when it encounters a left-recursive production. This is because it applies the grammar productions blindly, without considering the actual input sentence. A leftcorner parser is a hybrid between the bottom-up and top-down approaches we have seen. \nA left-corner parser is a top-down parser with bottom-up filtering. Unlike an ordinary recursive descent parser, it does not get trapped in left-recursive productions. Before starting its work, a left-corner parser preprocesses the context-free grammar to build a table where each row contains two cells, the first holding a non-terminal, and the second holding the collection of possible left corners of that non-terminal. Table 8-2 illustrates this for the grammar from grammar2.",

When this happens, no input remains, and the stack contains items that cannot be reduced to an S. The problem arises because there are choices made earlier that cannot be undone by the parser (although users of the graphical demonstration can undo their choices). There are two kinds of choices to be made by the parser: (a) which reduction to do when more than one is possible and (b) whether to shift or reduce when either action is possible. \nA shift-reduce parser may be extended to implement policies for resolving such conflicts. For example, it may address shift-reduce conflicts by shifting only when no reductions are possible, and it may address reduce-reduce conflicts by favoring the reduction operation that removes the most items from the stack. (A generalization of the shift-reduce parser, a “lookahead LR parser,” is commonly used in programming language compilers.) \nThe advantages of shift-reduce parsers over recursive descent parsers is that they only build structure that corresponds to the words in the input. Furthermore, they only build each substructure once; e.g., NP(Det(the), N(man)) is only built and pushed onto the stack a single time, regardless of whether it will later be used by the VP -> V NP PP reduction or the NP -> NP PP reduction. \nThe Left-Corner Parser \nOne of the problems with the recursive descent parser is that it goes into an infinite loop when it encounters a left-recursive production. This is because it applies the grammar productions blindly, without considering the actual input sentence. A leftcorner parser is a hybrid between the bottom-up and top-down approaches we have seen. \nA left-corner parser is a top-down parser with bottom-up filtering. Unlike an ordinary recursive descent parser, it does not get trapped in left-recursive productions. Before starting its work, a left-corner parser preprocesses the context-free grammar to build a table where each row contains two cells, the first holding a non-terminal, and the second holding the collection of possible left corners of that non-terminal. Table 8-2 illustrates this for the grammar from grammar2. \nEach time a production is considered by the parser, it checks that the next input word is compatible with at least one of the pre-terminal categories in the left-corner table. \nWell-Formed Substring Tables \nThe simple parsers discussed in the previous sections suffer from limitations in both completeness and efficiency. In order to remedy these, we will apply the algorithm design technique of dynamic programming to the parsing problem. As we saw in Section 4.7, dynamic programming stores intermediate results and reuses them when appropriate, achieving significant efficiency gains. This technique can be applied to syntactic parsing, allowing us to store partial solutions to the parsing task and then look them up as necessary in order to efficiently arrive at a complete solution. This approach to parsing is known as chart parsing. We introduce the main idea in this section; see the online materials available for this chapter for more implementation details. \nDynamic programming allows us to build the PP in my pajamas just once. The first time we build it we save it in a table, then we look it up when we need to use it as a subconstituent of either the object NP or the higher VP. This table is known as a well-formed substring table, or WFST for short. (The term “substring” refers to a contiguous sequence of words within a sentence.) We will show how to construct the WFST bottomup so as to systematically record what syntactic constituents have been found. \nLet’s set our input to be the sentence in (2). The numerically specified spans of the WFST are reminiscent of Python’s slice notation (Section 3.2). Another way to think about the data structure is shown in Figure 8-6, a data structure known as a chart. \nIn a WFST, we record the position of the words by filling in cells in a triangular matrix: the vertical axis will denote the start position of a substring, while the horizontal axis will denote the end position (thus shot will appear in the cell with coordinates (1, 2)). To simplify this presentation, we will assume each word has a unique lexical category, and we will store this (not the word) in the matrix. So cell (1, 2) will contain the entry V. More generally, if our input string is $a _ { 1 } a _ { 2 } dots a _ { n }$ , and our grammar contains a production of the form $A  a _ { i } ,$ then we add $A$ to the cell $( i mathrm { - } 1 , i )$ .",

We also define a utility function display() to pretty-print the WFST for us. As expected, there is a $mathsf { v }$ in cell $( 1 , 2 )$ . \nExample 8-3.

P · PP   \n5 Det NP   \n6 · · N \n\nReturning to our tabular representation, given that we have Det in cell (2, 3) for the word an, and $mathsf { N }$ in cell (3, 4) for the word elephant, what should we put into cell (2, 4) for an elephant? We need to find a production of the form $A to { mathsf { D e t } } { mathsf { N } }$ . Consulting the grammar, we know that we can enter NP in cell (0, 2). \nMore generally, we can enter $A$ in $( i , j )$ if there is a production $A to B C$ , and we find non-terminal $B$ in $( i , k )$ and $C$ in $( k , j )$ . The program in Example 8-3 uses this rule to complete the WFST. By setting trace to True when calling the function complete_wfst(), we see tracing output that shows the WFST being constructed: \n>>> fst1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ complete_wfst(wfst0, tokens, groucho_grammar, trace $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ True)   \n[2] Det [3] N [4] $scriptstyle mathbf { alpha = } gamma$ [2] NP [4]   \n[5] Det [6] N $scriptstyle mathbf { alpha } = mathbf { beta }$ [5] NP [7]   \n[1] V [2] NP $scriptstyle mathbf { alpha } = mathbf { beta }$ [1] VP [4]   \n[4] P [5] NP $scriptstyle mathbf { alpha } = mathbf { beta }$ [4] PP [7]   \n[0] NP [1] VP $scriptstyle mathbf { alpha } = mathbf { beta }$ [0] S [4]   \n[1] VP [4] PP [7] $scriptstyle mathbf { alpha } = mathbf { beta }$ [1] VP [7]   \n[0] NP [1] VP [7] $scriptstyle Rightarrow$ [0] S [7] \nFor example, this says that since we found Det at wfst[0][1] and N at wfst[1][2], we can add NP to wfst[0][2]. \nTo help us easily retrieve productions by their righthand sides, we create an index for the grammar. This is an example of a space-time trade-off: we do a reverse lookup on the grammar, instead of having to check through entire list of productions each time we want to look up via the righthand side. \nWe conclude that there is a parse for the whole input string once we have constructed an S node in cell (0, 7), showing that we have found a sentence that covers the whole input. The final state of the WFST is depicted in Figure 8-7. \nNotice that we have not used any built-in parsing functions here. We’ve implemented a complete primitive chart parser from the ground up! \nWFSTs have several shortcomings. First, as you can see, the WFST is not itself a parse tree, so the technique is strictly speaking recognizing that a sentence is admitted by a grammar, rather than parsing it. Second, it requires every non-lexical grammar production to be binary. Although it is possible to convert an arbitrary CFG into this form, we would prefer to use an approach without such a requirement. Third, as a bottomup approach it is potentially wasteful, being able to propose constituents in locations that would not be licensed by the grammar. \n\nFinally, the WFST did not represent the structural ambiguity in the sentence (i.e., the two verb phrase readings). The VP in cell (2,8) was actually entered twice, once for a V NP reading, and once for a VP PP reading. These are different hypotheses, and the second overwrote the first (as it happens, this didn’t matter since the lefthand side was the same). Chart parsers use a slightly richer data structure and some interesting algorithms to solve these problems (see Section 8.8). \nYour Turn: Try out the interactive chart parser application nltk.app.chartparser(). \n8.5  Dependencies and Dependency Grammar \nPhrase structure grammar is concerned with how words and sequences of words combine to form constituents. A distinct and complementary approach, dependency grammar, focuses instead on how words relate to other words. Dependency is a binary asymmetric relation that holds between a head and its dependents. The head of a sentence is usually taken to be the tensed verb, and every other word is either dependent on the sentence head or connects to it through a path of dependencies. \nA dependency representation is a labeled directed graph, where the nodes are the lexical items and the labeled arcs represent dependency relations from heads to dependents. Figure 8-8 illustrates a dependency graph, where arrows point from heads to their dependents.",

        "content": "These bracketed dependency structures can also be displayed as trees, where dependents are shown as children of their heads. \nIn languages with more flexible word order than English, non-projective dependencies are more frequent. \nVarious criteria have been proposed for deciding what is the head $H$ and what is the dependent $D$ in a construction C. Some of the most important are the following: \n1. $H$ determines the distribution class of $C$ ; or alternatively, the external syntactic properties of $C$ are due to $H$ .   \n2. $H$ determines the semantic type of $C$ .   \n3. $H$ is obligatory while $D$ may be optional.   \n4. H selects $D$ and determines whether it is obligatory or optional.   \n5. The morphological form of $D$ is determined by $H$ (e.g., agreement or case government). \nWhen we say in a phrase structure grammar that the immediate constituents of a PP are P and NP, we are implicitly appealing to the head/dependent distinction. A prepositional phrase is a phrase whose head is a preposition; moreover, the NP is a dependent of P. The same distinction carries over to the other types of phrase that we have discussed. The key point to note here is that although phrase structure grammars seem very different from dependency grammars, they implicitly embody a recognition of dependency relations. Although CFGs are not intended to directly capture dependencies, more recent linguistic frameworks have increasingly adopted formalisms which combine aspects of both approaches. \nValency and the Lexicon \nLet us take a closer look at verbs and their dependents. The grammar in Example 8-2 correctly generates examples like (12). \n(12) a. The squirrel was frightened. b. Chatterer saw the bear. c. Chatterer thought Buster was angry. d. Joe put the fish on the log. \nThese possibilities correspond to the productions in Table 8-3. \nThat is, was can occur with a following Adj, saw can occur with a following NP, thought can occur with a following S, and put can occur with a following NP and PP. The dependents Adj, NP, S, and PP are often called complements of the respective verbs, and there are strong constraints on what verbs can occur with what complements. By contrast with (12), the word sequences in (13) are ill-formed: \n(13) a. *The squirrel was Buster was angry. b. *Chatterer saw frightened. c. *Chatterer thought the bear. d. *Joe put on the log. \nWith a little imagination, it is possible to invent contexts in which unusual combinations of verbs and complements are interpretable. However, we assume that the examples in (13) are to be interpreted in neutral contexts. \nIn the tradition of dependency grammar, the verbs in Table 8-3 are said to have different valencies. Valency restrictions are not just applicable to verbs, but also to the other classes of heads. \nWithin frameworks based on phrase structure grammar, various techniques have been proposed for excluding the ungrammatical examples in (13). In a CFG, we need some way of constraining grammar productions which expand VP so that verbs co-occur only with their correct complements. We can do this by dividing the class of verbs into “subcategories,” each of which is associated with a different set of complements. For example, transitive verbs such as chased and saw require a following NP object complement; that is, they are subcategorized for NP direct objects. If we introduce a new category label for transitive verbs, namely TV (for transitive verb), then we can use it in the following productions: \n\nVP -> TV NP TV -> 'chased' | 'saw' \nNow *Joe thought the bear is excluded since we haven’t listed thought as a TV, but Chatterer saw the bear is still allowed. Table 8-4 provides more examples of labels for verb subcategories. \nValency is a property of lexical items, and we will discuss it further in Chapter 9. \nComplements are often contrasted with modifiers (or adjuncts), although both are kinds of dependents. Prepositional phrases, adjectives, and adverbs typically function as modifiers. Unlike complements, modifiers are optional, can often be iterated, and are not selected for by heads in the same way as complements. For example, the adverb really can be added as a modifier to all the sentences in (14): \n(14) a. The squirrel really was frightened. b. Chatterer really saw the bear. c. Chatterer really thought Buster was angry. d. Joe really put the fish on the log. \nThe structural ambiguity of PP attachment, which we have illustrated in both phrase structure and dependency grammars, corresponds semantically to an ambiguity in the scope of the modifier. \nScaling Up \nSo far, we have only considered “toy grammars,” small grammars that illustrate the key aspects of parsing. But there is an obvious question as to whether the approach can be scaled up to cover large corpora of natural languages. How hard would it be to construct such a set of productions by hand? In general, the answer is: very hard. Even if we allow ourselves to use various formal devices that give much more succinct representations of grammar productions, it is still extremely difficult to keep control of the complex interactions between the many productions required to cover the major constructions of a language. In other words, it is hard to modularize grammars so that one portion can be developed independently of the other parts. This in turn means that it is difficult to distribute the task of grammar writing across a team of linguists. Another difficulty is that as the grammar expands to cover a wider and wider range of constructions, there is a corresponding increase in the number of analyses that are admitted for any one sentence. In other words, ambiguity increases with coverage.",

Here we illustrate a technique for mining this corpus. It finds pairs of prepositional phrases where the preposition and noun are fixed, but where the choice of verb determines whether the prepositional phrase is attached to the VP or to the NP. \n>>> entries $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.corpus.ppattach.attachments('training')   \n>>> table $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.defaultdict(lambda: nltk.defaultdict(set))   \n>>> for entry in entries: key $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ entry.noun1 $^ +$ '-' $^ +$ entry.prep $^ +$ '-' + entry.noun2 table[key][entry.attachment].add(entry.verb)   \n>>> for key in sorted(table): if len(table[key]) > 1: print key, 'N:', sorted(table[key]['N']), 'V:', sorted(table[key]['V']) \nAmong the output lines of this program we find offer-from-group N: ['rejected'] V: ['received'], which indicates that received expects a separate PP complement attached to the VP, while rejected does not. As before, we can use this information to help construct the grammar. \nThe NLTK corpus collection includes data from the PE08 Cross-Framework and Cross Domain Parser Evaluation Shared Task. A collection of larger grammars has been prepared for the purpose of comparing different parsers, which can be obtained by downloading the large_grammars package (e.g., python -m nltk.downloader large_grammars). \nThe NLTK corpus collection also includes a sample from the Sinica Treebank Corpus, consisting of 10,000 parsed sentences drawn from the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese. Let’s load and display one of the trees in this corpus. \n>>> nltk.corpus.sinica_treebank.parsed_sents()[3450].draw() \nPernicious Ambiguity \nUnfortunately, as the coverage of the grammar increases and the length of the input sentences grows, the number of parse trees grows rapidly. In fact, it grows at an astronomical rate. \nLet’s explore this issue with the help of a simple example. The word fish is both a noun and a verb. We can make up the sentence fish fish fish, meaning fish like to fish for other fish. (Try this with police if you prefer something more sensible.)

However, in a broad-coverage grammar, $a$ is also a noun (e.g., part a), dog is also a verb (meaning to follow closely), and runs is also a noun (e.g., ski runs). In fact, all words can be referred to by name: e.g., the verb ‘ate’ is spelled with three letters; in speech we do not need to supply quotation marks. Furthermore, it is possible to verb most nouns. Thus a parser for a broad-coverage grammar will be overwhelmed with ambiguity. Even complete gibberish will often have a reading, e.g., the a are of I. As (Abney, 1996) has pointed out, this is not word salad but a grammatical noun phrase, in which are is a noun meaning a hundredth of a hectare (or $1 0 0 mathrm { s q m } ,$ ), and $a$ and $I$ are nouns designating coordinates, as shown in Figure 8-9.",

In fact, it grows at an astronomical rate. \nLet’s explore this issue with the help of a simple example. The word fish is both a noun and a verb. We can make up the sentence fish fish fish, meaning fish like to fish for other fish. (Try this with police if you prefer something more sensible.) Here is a toy grammar for the “fish” sentences. \n>>> grammar $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.parse_cfg(\"\"\" S -> NP V NP NP -> NP Sbar Sbar -> NP V . NP -> 'fish' .

Kim gave the dog a bone. \nIn the “double object” form in (16b), the indirect object appears first, followed by the direct object. In this case, either order is acceptable. However, if the indirect object is a pronoun, there is a strong preference for the double object construction: \n(17) a. Kim gives the heebie-jeebies to me (prepositional dative) b. Kim gives me the heebie-jeebies (double object). \nUsing the Penn Treebank sample, we can examine all instances of prepositional dative and double object constructions involving give, as shown in Example 8-5. \nExample 8-5.

However, this does not account for a form like give NP: federal judges / NP: a raise, where animacy may play a role. In fact, there turns out to be a large number of contributing factors, as surveyed by (Bresnan & Hay, 2008). Such preferences can be represented in a weighted grammar. \nA probabilistic context-free grammar (or PCFG) is a context-free grammar that associates a probability with each of its productions. It generates the same set of parses for a text that the corresponding context-free grammar does, and assigns a probability to each parse. The probability of a parse generated by a PCFG is simply the product of the probabilities of the productions used to generate it. \nThe simplest way to define a PCFG is to load it from a specially formatted string consisting of a sequence of weighted productions, where weights appear in brackets, as shown in Example 8-6. \nExample 8-6. Defining a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). \ngrammar = nltk.parse_pcfg(\"\"\" S -> NP VP [1.0] VP -> TV NP [0.4] VP -> IV [0.3] VP -> DatV NP NP [0.3] TV -> 'saw' [1.0] IV -> 'ate' [1.0] DatV -> 'gave' [1.0] NP -> 'telescopes' [0.8] NP -> 'Jack' [0.2] \"\"\") \n>>> print grammar   \nGrammar with 9 productions (start state $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma } S$ ) S -> NP VP [1.0] VP -> TV NP [0.4] VP -> IV [0.3] VP -> DatV NP NP [0.3] TV -> 'saw' [1.0] IV -> 'ate' [1.0] DatV -> 'gave' [1.0] NP -> 'telescopes' [0.8] NP -> 'Jack' [0.2] \nIt is sometimes convenient to combine multiple productions into a single line, e.g., VP -> TV NP [0.4] | IV [0.3] | DatV NP NP [0.3]. In order to ensure that the trees generated by the grammar form a probability distribution, PCFG grammars impose the constraint that all productions with a given lefthand side must have probabilities that sum to one. The grammar in Example 8-6 obeys this constraint: for S, there is only one production, with a probability of 1.0; for VP, $0 . 4 substack { + 0 . 3 substack { + 0 . 3 = 1 . 0 } }$ ; and for NP, $0 . 8 substack { + 0 . 2 = 1 . 0 }$ . The parse tree returned by parse() includes probabilities: \n>>> viterbi_parser $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ViterbiParser(grammar) >>> print viterbi_parser.parse(['Jack', 'saw', 'telescopes']) (S (NP Jack) (VP (TV saw) (NP telescopes))) $scriptstyle left. { mathsf { p } } = 0 . 0 6 4 right)$ ) \nNow that parse trees are assigned probabilities, it no longer matters that there may be a huge number of possible parses for a given sentence. A parser will be responsible for finding the most likely parses. \n8.7  Summary \nSentences have internal organization that can be represented using a tree. Notable features of constituent structure are: recursion, heads, complements, and modifiers. \n• A grammar is a compact characterization of a potentially infinite set of sentences; we say that a tree is well-formed according to a grammar, or that a grammar licenses a tree.   \n• A grammar is a formal model for describing whether a given phrase can be assigned a particular constituent or dependency structure.   \n• Given a set of syntactic categories, a context-free grammar uses a set of productions to say how a phrase of some category $A$ can be analyzed into a sequence of smaller parts ${ mathfrak { a } } _ { 1 } ldots { mathfrak { a } } _ { n }$ .   \n• A dependency grammar uses productions to specify what the dependents are of a given lexical head. Syntactic ambiguity arises when one sentence has more than one syntactic analysis (e.g., prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity).   \n• A parser is a procedure for finding one or more trees corresponding to a grammatically well-formed sentence.   \n• A simple top-down parser is the recursive descent parser, which recursively expands the start symbol (usually S) with the help of the grammar productions, and tries to match the input sentence. This parser cannot handle left-recursive productions (e.g., productions such as NP -> NP PP). It is inefficient in the way it blindly expands categories without checking whether they are compatible with the input string, and in repeatedly expanding the same non-terminals and discarding the results.   \n• A simple bottom-up parser is the shift-reduce parser, which shifts input onto a stack and tries to match the items at the top of the stack with the righthand side of grammar productions. This parser is not guaranteed to find a valid parse for the input, even if one exists, and builds substructures without checking whether it is globally consistent with the grammar.",

Based on these productions, use the method of the preceding exercise to draw a tree for the sentence Lee ran away home. \n16. ◑ Pick some common verbs and complete the following tasks: \na. Write a program to find those verbs in the PP Attachment Corpus nltk.cor pus.ppattach. Find any cases where the same verb exhibits two different attachments, but where the first noun, or second noun, or preposition stays unchanged (as we saw in our discussion of syntactic ambiguity in Section 8.2). b. Devise CFG grammar productions to cover some of these cases. \n17. ◑ Write a program to compare the efficiency of a top-down chart parser compared with a recursive descent parser (Section 8.4). Use the same grammar and input sentences for both. Compare their performance using the timeit module (see Section 4.7 for an example of how to do this).   \n18. $mathbf { 0 }$ Compare the performance of the top-down, bottom-up, and left-corner parsers using the same grammar and three grammatical test sentences. Use timeit to log the amount of time each parser takes on the same sentence. Write a function that runs all three parsers on all three sentences, and prints a 3-by-3 grid of times, as well as row and column totals. Discuss your findings.   \n19. ◑ Read up on “garden path” sentences. How might the computational work of a parser relate to the difficulty humans have with processing these sentences? (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence.)   \n20. ◑ To compare multiple trees in a single window, we can use the draw_trees() method. Define some trees and try it out: >>> from nltk.draw.tree import draw_trees >>> draw_trees(tree1, tree2, tree3)   \n21. ◑ Using tree positions, list the subjects of the first 100 sentences in the Penn treebank; to make the results easier to view, limit the extracted subjects to subtrees whose height is at most 2.   \n22. ◑ Inspect the PP Attachment Corpus and try to suggest some factors that influence PP attachment.   \n23. ◑ In Section 8.2, we claimed that there are linguistic regularities that cannot be described simply in terms of n-grams. Consider the following sentence, particularly the position of the phrase in his turn. Does this illustrate a problem for an approach based on n-grams? What was more, the in his turn somewhat youngish Nikolay Parfenovich also turned out to be the only person in the entire world to acquire a sincere liking to our “discriminated-against” public procurator. (Dostoevsky: The Brothers Karamazov) \n24. ◑ Write a recursive function that produces a nested bracketing for a tree, leaving out the leaf nodes and displaying the non-terminal labels after their subtrees. So the example in Section 8.6 about Pierre Vinken would produce: [[[NNP NNP]NP , [ADJP [CD NNS]NP JJ]ADJP ,]NP-SBJ MD [VB [DT NN]NP [IN [DT JJ NN]NP]PP-CLR [NNP CD]NP-TMP]VP .]S. Consecutive categories should be separated by space. \n25. ◑ Download several electronic books from Project Gutenberg. Write a program to scan these texts for any extremely long sentences. What is the longest sentence you can find? What syntactic construction(s) are responsible for such long sentences?   \n26. ◑ Modify the functions init_wfst() and complete_wfst() so that the contents of each cell in the WFST is a set of non-terminal symbols rather than a single nonterminal.   \n27. ◑ Consider the algorithm in Example 8-3. Can you explain why parsing contextfree grammar is proportional to $n ^ { 3 }$ , where $n$ is the length of the input sentence?   \n28. ◑ Process each tree of the Penn Treebank Corpus sample nltk.corpus.treebank and extract the productions with the help of Tree.productions(). Discard the productions that occur only once. Productions with the same lefthand side and similar righthand sides can be collapsed, resulting in an equivalent but more compact set of rules. Write code to output a compact grammar.   \n29. ● One common way of defining the subject of a sentence S in English is as the noun phrase that is the child of S and the sibling of VP. Write a function that takes the tree for a sentence and returns the subtree corresponding to the subject of the sentence. What should it do if the root node of the tree passed to this function is not S, or if it lacks a subject?   \n30. $bullet$ Write a function that takes a grammar (such as the one defined in Example 8-1) and returns a random sentence generated by the grammar. (Use gram mar.start() to find the start symbol of the grammar; grammar.productions(lhs) to get the list of productions from the grammar that have the specified lefthand side; and production.rhs() to get the righthand side of a production.)   \n31. $bullet$ Implement a version of the shift-reduce parser using backtracking, so that it finds all possible parses for a sentence, what might be called a “recursive ascent parser.” Consult the Wikipedia entry for backtracking at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back tracking.   \n32. $bullet$ As we saw in Chapter 7, it is possible to collapse chunks down to their chunk label. When we do this for sentences involving the word gave, we find patterns such as the following: gave NP gave up NP in NP gave NP up \ngave NP NP gave NP to NP \na. Use this method to study the complementation patterns of a verb of interest, and write suitable grammar productions. (This task is sometimes called lexical acquisition.) b. Identify some English verbs that are near-synonyms, such as the dumped/filled/ loaded example from (64) in Chapter 9. Use the chunking method to study the complementation patterns of these verbs. Create a grammar to cover these cases. Can the verbs be freely substituted for each other, or are there constraints? Discuss your findings.   \n33. ● Develop a left-corner parser based on the recursive descent parser, and inheriting from ParseI.   \n34. ● Extend NLTK’s shift-reduce parser to incorporate backtracking, so that it is guaranteed to find all parses that exist (i.e., it is complete).   \n35. $bullet$ Modify the functions init_wfst() and complete_wfst() so that when a nonterminal symbol is added to a cell in the WFST, it includes a record of the cells from which it was derived. Implement a function that will convert a WFST in this form to a parse tree. \nBuilding Feature-Based Grammars \nNatural languages have an extensive range of grammatical constructions which are hard to handle with the simple methods described in Chapter 8. In order to gain more flexibility, we change our treatment of grammatical categories like S, NP, and V. In place of atomic labels, we decompose them into structures like dictionaries, where features can take on a range of values. \nThe goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions: \n1. How can we extend the framework of context-free grammars with features so as to gain more fine-grained control over grammatical categories and productions?   \n2. What are the main formal properties of feature structures, and how do we use them computationally?   \n3. What kinds of linguistic patterns and grammatical constructions can we now capture with feature-based grammars? \nAlong the way, we will cover more topics in English syntax, including phenomena such as agreement, subcategorization, and unbounded dependency constructions. \n9.1  Grammatical Features \nIn Chapter 6, we described how to build classifiers that rely on detecting features of text. Such features may be quite simple, such as extracting the last letter of a word, or more complex, such as a part-of-speech tag that has itself been predicted by the classifier. In this chapter, we will investigate the role of features in building rule-based grammars. In contrast to feature extractors, which record features that have been automatically detected, we are now going to declare the features of words and phrases. We start off with a very simple example, using dictionaries to store features and their values. \n>>> kim = {'CAT': 'NP', 'ORTH': 'Kim', 'REF': 'k'} >>> chase $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ {'CAT': 'V', 'ORTH': 'chased', 'REL': 'chase'}",

        "content": "Since feature structures are a general data structure for representing information of any kind, we will briefly look at them from a more formal point of view, and illustrate the support for feature structures offered by NLTK. In the final part of the chapter, we demonstrate that the additional expressiveness of features opens up a wide spectrum of possibilities for describing sophisticated aspects of linguistic structure. \nSyntactic Agreement \nThe following examples show pairs of word sequences, the first of which is grammatical and the second not. (We use an asterisk at the start of a word sequence to signal that it is ungrammatical.) \n(1) a. this dog b. *these dog   \n(2) a. these dogs b. *this dogs \nIn English, nouns are usually marked as being singular or plural. The form of the demonstrative also varies: this (singular) and these (plural). Examples (1) and (2) show that there are constraints on the use of demonstratives and nouns within a noun phrase: either both are singular or both are plural. A similar constraint holds between subjects and predicates: \n(3) a. the dog runs b. *the dog run   \n(4) a. the dogs run b. *the dogs runs \nHere we can see that morphological properties of the verb co-vary with syntactic properties of the subject noun phrase. This co-variance is called agreement. If we look further at verb agreement in English, we will see that present tense verbs typically have two inflected forms: one for third person singular, and another for every other combination of person and number, as shown in Table 9-1. \nWe can make the role of morphological properties a bit more explicit, as illustrated in (5) and (6). These representations indicate that the verb agrees with its subject in person and number. (We use 3 as an abbreviation for 3rd person, SG for singular, and PL for plural.) \n(5) the dog run-s dog.3.SG run-3.SG   \n(6) the dog-s run dog.3.PL run-3.PL \nLet’s see what happens when we encode these agreement constraints in a context-free grammar. We will begin with the simple CFG in (7). \n(7) S -> NP VP NP -> Det N VP -> V Det -> 'this' N -> 'dog' V -> 'runs' \nGrammar (7) allows us to generate the sentence this dog runs; however, what we really want to do is also generate these dogs run while blocking unwanted sequences like *this dogs run and *these dog runs. The most straightforward approach is to add new nonterminals and productions to the grammar: \n(8) S -> NP_SG VP_SG S -> NP_PL VP_PL NP_SG -> Det_SG N_SG NP_PL -> Det_PL N_PL VP_SG -> V_SG VP_PL -> V_PL Det_SG -> 'this' Det_PL -> 'these' N_SG -> 'dog' N_PL -> 'dogs V_SG -> 'runs' V_PL -> 'run' \nIn place of a single production expanding S, we now have two productions, one covering the sentences involving singular subject NPs and VPs, the other covering sentences with plural subject NPs and VPs. In fact, every production in (7) has two counterparts in (8). With a small grammar, this is not really such a problem, although it is aesthetically unappealing. However, with a larger grammar that covers a reasonable subset of English constructions, the prospect of doubling the grammar size is very unattractive. Let’s suppose now that we used the same approach to deal with first, second, and third person agreement, for both singular and plural. This would lead to the original grammar being multiplied by a factor of 6, which we definitely want to avoid. Can we do better than this? In the next section, we will show that capturing number and person agreement need not come at the cost of “blowing up” the number of productions. \n\nUsing Attributes and Constraints \nWe spoke informally of linguistic categories having properties, for example, that a noun has the property of being plural. Let’s make this explicit: \n(9) N[NUM=pl] \nIn (9), we have introduced some new notation which says that the category N has a (grammatical) feature called NUM (short for “number”) and that the value of this feature is pl (short for “plural”). We can add similar annotations to other categories, and use them in lexical entries: \n(10) Det[NUM=sg] -> 'this' Det[NUM=pl] -> 'these' $begin{array} { r l } { {  N big [ mathsf { N U M } = mathsf { s g } big ] } } & { { to } } & { ^ { * } mathsf { d o g } ^ { * } }  { {  N big [ mathsf { N U M } = mathsf { p } mathrm { 1 } big ] } } & { { to } } & { ^ { * } mathsf { d o g s } ^ { * } }  { {  V big [ mathsf { N U M } = mathsf { s g } big ] } } & { { to } } & { ^ { * } tau mathsf { u n s } ^ { * } }  { {  V big [ mathsf { N U M } = mathsf { p } mathrm { 1 } big ] } } & { { to } } & { ^ { * } tau mathsf { u n } ^ { * } } end{array}$ \nDoes this help at all? So far, it looks just like a slightly more verbose alternative to what was specified in (8). Things become more interesting when we allow variables over feature values, and use these to state constraints: \nWe are using ?n as a variable over values of NUM; it can be instantiated either to sg or ${ mathsf p } mathbf { 1 }$ , within a given production. We can read the first production as saying that whatever value NP takes for the feature NUM, VP must take the same value. \nIn order to understand how these feature constraints work, it’s helpful to think about how one would go about building a tree. Lexical productions will admit the following local trees (trees of depth one):",

Lexical productions will admit the following local trees (trees of depth one): \n(12) a. Det[NUM=sg] this b.Det[NUM=pl] these \n(13) a. dog b.N[NUM=pl] dogs \nNow N $P [ N U M = ? n ]$ -> Det[NUM=?n] $N [ N U M = ? n ]$ says that whatever the NUM values of $mathsf { N }$ and Det are, they have to be the same. Consequently, this production will permit (12a) and (13a) to be combined into an NP, as shown in (14a), and it will also allow (12b) and (13b) to be combined, as in (14b). By contrast, (15a) and (15b) are prohibited because the roots of their subtrees differ in their values for the NUM feature; this incompatibility of values is indicated informally with a FAIL value at the top node. \n(14) a. NP[NUM=sg] Det[NUM=sg] N[NUM=sg] this dog b. NP[NUM=pl] Det[NUM=pl] N[NUM=pl] these dogs \n(15) a. NP[NUM=FAIL] Det[NUM=sg] N[NUM=pl] this dogs b. NP[NUM=FAIL] Det[NUM=pl] N[NUM=sg] these dog \nProduction $V P [ N U M = ? n ]  V [ N U M = ? n ]$ says that the NUM value of the head verb has to be the same as the NUM value of the VP parent. Combined with the production for expanding S, we derive the consequence that if the NUM value of the subject head noun is pl, then so is the NUM value of the VP’s head verb. \n(16) S NP[NUM=pl] VP[NUM=pl] Det[NUM=pl] N[NUM=pl] V[NUM=pl] these dogs run \nGrammar (10) illustrated lexical productions for determiners like this and these, which require a singular or plural head noun respectively. However, other determiners in English are not choosy about the grammatical number of the noun they combine with. One way of describing this would be to add two lexical entries to the grammar, one each for the singular and plural versions of a determiner such as the: \nDet[NUM=sg] -> 'the' 'some' 'several' Det[NUM=pl] -> 'the' 'some' 'several' \nHowever, a more elegant solution is to leave the NUM value underspecified and let it agree in number with whatever noun it combines with. Assigning a variable value to NUM is one way of achieving this result: \nDet[NUM=?n] -> 'the' | 'some' | 'several' \nBut in fact we can be even more economical, and just omit any specification for NUM in such productions. We only need to explicitly enter a variable value when this constrains another value elsewhere in the same production. \nThe grammar in Example 9-1 illustrates most of the ideas we have introduced so far in this chapter, plus a couple of new ones. \n>>> nltk.data.show_cfg('grammars/book_grammars/feat0.fcfg')   \n$%$ start S   \n# ###################   \n# Grammar Productions   \n# ###################   \n# S expansion productions   \nS -> NP[NUM=?n] VP[NUM=?n]   \n# NP expansion productions   \nNP[NUM=?n] -> N[NUM=?n]   \nNP[NUM=?n] -> PropN[NUM=?n]   \nNP[NUM=?n] -> Det[NUM=?n] N[NUM=?n]   \nNP[NUM=pl] -> N[NUM=pl]   \n# VP expansion productions   \nVP[TENSE $ c =$ ?t, NUM=?n] $$ IV[TENSE=?t, NUM=?n]   \nVP[TENSE=?t, NUM=?n] -> TV[TENSE=?t, NUM=?n] NP   \n# ###################   \n# Lexical Productions   \n# ###################   \nDet[NUM $vDash$ sg] -> 'this' 'every'   \nDet[NUM=pl] -> 'these' 'all'   \nDet -> 'the' | 'some' 'several'   \nPropN[NUM=sg]-> 'Kim' | 'Jody'   \nN[NUM=sg] -> 'dog' | 'girl' | 'car' | 'child'   \nN[NUM=pl] -> 'dogs' | 'girls' | 'cars' | 'children'   \nIV[TENSE $ c =$ pres,  NUM=sg] -> 'disappears' | 'walks'   \nTV[TENSE=pres, NUM=sg] -> 'sees' | 'likes'   \nIV[TENSE=pres,  NUM=pl] -> 'disappear' | 'walk'   \nTV[TENSE=pres, NUM=pl] -> 'see' 'like'   \nIV[TENSE=past] -> 'disappeared' | 'walked'   \nTV[TENSE=past] -> 'saw' | 'liked' \nNotice that a syntactic category can have more than one feature: for example, V[TENSE=pres, $N U M = p 1$ ]. In general, we can add as many features as we like. \nA final detail about Example 9-1 is the statement %start S. This “directive” tells the parser to take S as the start symbol for the grammar. \nIn general, when we are trying to develop even a very small grammar, it is convenient to put the productions in a file where they can be edited, tested, and revised. We have saved Example 9-1 as a file named feat0.fcfg in the NLTK data distribution. You can make your own copy of this for further experimentation using nltk.data.load(). \nFeature-based grammars are parsed in NLTK using an Earley chart parser (see Section 9.5 for more information about this) and Example 9-2 illustrates how this is carried out. After tokenizing the input, we import the load_parser function $bullet$ , which takes a grammar filename as input and returns a chart parser cp . Calling the parser’s nbest_parse() method will return a list trees of parse trees; trees will be empty if the grammar fails to parse the input and otherwise will contain one or more parse trees, depending on whether the input is syntactically ambiguous. \nExample 9-2.

However, there is an implementation issue which bears on our earlier discussion of grammar size. One possible approach to parsing productions containing feature constraints is to compile out all admissible values of the features in question so that we end up with a large, fully specified CFG along the lines of (8). By contrast, the parser process illustrated in the previous examples works directly with the underspecified productions given by the grammar. Feature values “flow upwards” from lexical entries, and variable values are then associated with those values via bindings (i.e., dictionaries) such as ${ ? mathsf { n } colon  \" mathsf { s g } ^ { prime }  ,  ? mathsf { t } colon  \" mathsf { p r e s } ^ { prime } }$ . As the parser assembles information about the nodes of the tree it is building, these variable bindings are used to instantiate values in these nodes; thus the underspecified VP[NUM $vert = ? n$ , $T E N S E = ? t$ ] -> TV[NUM=?n, $T E N S E = ? t$ ] NP[] becomes instantiated as $V P [ N U M = ^ { prime } S B ^ { prime }$ , ${ mathsf { T E N S E } } { mathsf { E } } { mathsf { = } } ^ { prime } { mathsf { p r e s } } ^ { prime } { mathsf { Delta } } { mathsf { J } } to { mathsf { T V } } { bigl [ } { mathsf { N U M } } { mathsf { M } } { mathsf { = } } ^ { prime } { mathsf { S } } { mathsf { g } } ^ { prime }$ , TENSE $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ 'pres'] NP[] by looking up the values of $? n$ and $vdots mathrm { t }$ in the bindings. \nFinally, we can inspect the resulting parse trees (in this case, a single one). \n>>> for tree in trees: print tree   \n(S[] (NP[NUM='sg'] (PropN[NUM='sg'] Kim)) (VP[NUM='sg', TENSE='pres'] (TV[NUM='sg', TENSE='pres'] likes) (NP[NUM='pl'] (N[NUM='pl'] children)))) \nTerminology \nSo far, we have only seen feature values like sg and pl. These simple values are usually called atomic—that is, they can’t be decomposed into subparts.

For example, we might want to distinguish auxiliary verbs such as can, may, will, and do with the Boolean feature AUX.

There is a widely adopted convention that abbreviates the representation of Boolean features $mathsf { f }$ ; instead of $mathsf { a u x } = +$ or $mathsf { a u x } = -$ , we use $+ a u x$ and -aux respectively. These are just abbreviations, however, and the parser interprets them as though $^ +$ and - are like any other atomic value. (17) shows some representative productions:",

(17) shows some representative productions: \n\n(17) V[TENSE=pres, +aux] -> 'can' V[TENSE=pres, +aux] -> 'may V[TENSE=pres, -aux] -> 'walks' V[TENSE=pres, -aux] -> 'likes' \nWe have spoken of attaching “feature annotations” to syntactic categories. A more radical approach represents the whole category—that is, the non-terminal symbol plus the annotation—as a bundle of features. For example, $N [ N U M = S 8 ]$ contains part-ofspeech information which can be represented as $P O S = N$ . An alternative notation for this category, therefore, is $[ P O S = N$ , NUM=sg]. \nIn addition to atomic-valued features, features may take values that are themselves feature structures. For example, we can group together agreement features (e.g., person, number, and gender) as a distinguished part of a category, serving as the value of AGR. In this case, we say that AGR has a complex value. (18) depicts the structure, in a format known as an attribute value matrix (AVM). \nIn passing, we should point out that there are alternative approaches for displaying AVMs; Figure 9-1 shows an example. Although feature structures rendered in the style of (18) are less visually pleasing, we will stick with this format, since it corresponds to the output we will be getting from NLTK. \nOn the topic of representation, we also note that feature structures, like dictionaries, assign no particular significance to the order of features. So (18) is equivalent to: \n(19) $begin{array}{c} { begin{array} { l l l } { [ { mathsf { A G R } }  =  [ { mathsf { N U M } }  =  { mathsf { p 1 } }  ] }  { [ { begin{array} { l l } { } & { } end{array} } ] }  { [ { begin{array} { l l } { } & { } end{array} } ] }  { [ { begin{array} { l l } { } & { } end{array} } ] }  { [ { begin{array} { l l } { } & { } end{array} } ] }  { [ { begin{array} { l l } { } & { } end{array} } ] }  { [ { mathsf { P O S } }  =  { mathsf { N } } } end{array} } ]  end{array} $ \nOnce we have the possibility of using features like AGR, we can refactor a grammar like Example 9-1 so that agreement features are bundled together. A tiny grammar illustrating this idea is shown in (20). \n(20) $S ~  ~ N P [ A G R = ? n ] ~ mathsf { V P } [ A G R = ? n ]$ $N P [ A G R = ? n ] ~  ~ mathsf { P r o p N } [ A G R = ? n ]$ VP[TENSE=?t, $A G R = ? n$ ] -> Cop[TENSE=?t, $A G R = ? n$ ] Adj Cop[TENSE=pres, $A G R = [ N U M = S 8$ , $P E R = 3 ]$ ] -> 'is' PropN[AGR $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ [NUM=sg, $P E R = 3$ ] -> 'Kim' Adj -> 'happy' \n9.2  Processing Feature Structures \nIn this section, we will show how feature structures can be constructed and manipulated in NLTK. We will also discuss the fundamental operation of unification, which allows us to combine the information contained in two different feature structures. \nFeature structures in NLTK are declared with the FeatStruct() constructor. Atomic feature values can be strings or integers. \n>>> fs1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FeatStruct(TENSE $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'past', NUM='sg')   \n>>> print fs1   \n$begin{array} { l c l } { { left[ begin{array} { l } { { mathsf { N U M } } }  { { mathsf { T E N S E } } } end{array} right] } } & { { = } } & { { ^ { bullet } { mathsf { S g } } ^ { bullet } } }  { { left[ begin{array} { l } { { mathsf { T E N S E } } } end{array} right] } } & { { = } } & { { ^ { bullet } { mathsf { p a s t } } ^ { bullet } } } end{array} begin{array} { l } { { rfloor } }  { { rfloor } } end{array}$ \nA feature structure is actually just a kind of dictionary, and so we access its values by indexing in the usual way. We can use our familiar syntax to assign values to features: \n>>> fs1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FeatStruct( $P E R = 3$ , NUM='pl', $G N D = 1$ fem')   \n>>> print fs1['GND']   \nfem   \n$> > > f s 1 [ \" ( A S E ^ { prime } ] = \" a c c \"$ \nWe can also define feature structures that have complex values, as discussed earlier. \n>>> fs2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FeatStruct( $mathrm { P } 0 mathsf { S } = \" mathsf { N } \"$ , $A G R = 9 5 1$ )   \n>>> print fs2 [ CASE = 'acc'   \n[ AGR = [ GND  = 'fem' NUM = 'pl' [ PER = 3   \n[ POS = 'N'",

        "content": "Subsumption and Unification \nIt is standard to think of feature structures as providing partial information about some object, in the sense that we can order feature structures according to how general they are. For example, (25a) is more general (less specific) than (25b), which in turn is more general than (25c). \n$begin{array} { r l } & { mathrm { Lambda _ { a . } ~ } left[ { mathsf { N U M M B E R ~ = ~ 7 4 } } right] }  & { mathrm { Lambda _ { b . } ~ } left[ { mathsf { N U M M B E R ~ = ~ 7 4 } } right. }  & { left. begin{array} { r l } { { mathsf { D } _ { mathsf { T R E F ~ mathsf { I } } } } } & { { mathsf { 1 } } }  { { mathsf { C } _ { mathsf { T R E F ~ mathsf { I } } } } } & { { mathsf { 1 } } } end{array} right] }  & { mathrm { Lambda _ { c . } ~ } left[ { mathsf { N U M B E R ~ = ~ 7 4 } } right. }  & { left. begin{array} { r l } { { mathsf { [ S T R E F ~ = ~ 7 4 } } } & { { mathsf { 1 } } }  { { mathsf { I } } } & { { mathsf { 1 } } } end{array} right] }  &  left. begin{array} { r l } { { mathsf { [ C I T Y ~ = ~ mathsf { Omega ^ { * } ~ mathsf { r u e } ~ mathsf { P a s c a l } } cdot mathsf { 1 } } } & { { mathsf { 1 } } }  { { mathsf { I } } } & { { mathsf { 1 } } } end{array} right] } end{array}$ \nThis ordering is called subsumption; a more general feature structure subsumes a less general one. If $F S _ { 0 }$ subsumes $F S _ { 1 }$ (formally, we write $F S _ { 0 } subseteq F S _ { 1 } rangle$ , then $F S _ { 1 }$ must have all the paths and path equivalences of $F S _ { 0 }$ , and may have additional paths and equivalences as well. Thus, (23) subsumes (24) since the latter has additional path equivalences. It should be obvious that subsumption provides only a partial ordering on feature structures, since some feature structures are incommensurable. For example, (26) neither subsumes nor is subsumed by (25a). \nSo we have seen that some feature structures are more specific than others. How do we go about specializing a given feature structure? For example, we might decide that addresses should consist of not just a street number and a street name, but also a city. That is, we might want to merge graph (27a) with (27b) to yield (27c). \n(27) \nMerging information from two feature structures is called unification and is supported by the unify() method. \n>>> fs1 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.FeatStruct(NUMBE $: R = 7 4$ , STREET $mathbf { bar { Psi } } = mathbf { Psi }$ 'rue Pascal')   \n>>> fs2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FeatStruct(CITY='Paris')   \n$gg >$ print fs1.unify(fs2)   \n[ CITY $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Paris' NUMBER = 74   \n[ STREET $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'rue Pascal' \nUnification is formally defined as a binary operation: $F S _ { 0 } sqcup F S _ { 1 }$ . Unification is symmetric, so $F S _ { 0 } sqcup F S _ { 1 } = F S _ { 1 } sqcup F S _ { 0 }$ . The same is true in Python: \n$gg >$ print fs2.unify(fs1) $begin{array} { r l } & { mathsf { Gamma } [ mathsf { Gamma } mathsf { C } mathsf { T } mathsf { T } mathsf { Y } mathsf { Gamma } = mathsf { Omega } ^ { star } mathsf { P a r i s } ^ { star ^ { star } } ] }  & { mathsf { Gamma } [ mathsf { Gamma } mathsf { N U M B E R } = 7 4 mathsf { Gamma } mathsf { Omega } ] }  & { mathsf { Gamma } [ mathsf { Gamma } mathsf { S } mathsf { T R E E T } = mathsf { Omega } ^ { star } mathsf { r u e } mathsf { P a s c a l } ^ { star } ] } end{array}$ \nIf we unify two feature structures that stand in the subsumption relationship, then the result of unification is the most specific of the two: \nFor example, the result of unifying (25b) with (25c) is (25c). \nUnification between $F S _ { 0 }$ and $F S _ { 1 }$ will fail if the two feature structures share a path $pi$ where the value of $pi$ in $F S _ { 0 }$ is a distinct atom from the value of $pi$ in $F S _ { 1 }$ . This is implemented by setting the result of unification to be None. \n>>> fs0 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FeatStruct(A='a')   \n>>> fs1 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FeatStruct $( A = ^ { prime } boldsymbol { b } ^ { prime } )$   \n>>> fs2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ fs0.unify(fs1)   \n>>> print fs2   \nNone \nNow, if we look at how unification interacts with structure-sharing, things become really interesting. First, let’s define (23) in Python: \n>>> fs0 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FeatStruct(\"\"\"[NAME=Lee, ADDRESS $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ [NUMBER=74, STREET $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ 'rue Pascal'], SPOUSE $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ [NAME=Kim, ADDRESS=[NUMBER=74, STREET $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ 'rue Pascal']]]\"\"\")   \n>>> print fs0   \n$ begin{array} { l l l } { { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { { mathsf { A D D R E S S } } } & { = { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { { mathsf { M D M B E R } } } & { = } & { 7 4 } & & { } end{array} right] } } & { }  { { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { { mathsf { S T R E F I } } } & { = } & { cdot } { mathsf { r u e ~ } } & { { mathsf { P a s c a l } } ^ { cdot } } & { { mathsf { I } } } end{array} right] } } & { } & { }  { { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { } & { } & { } & { } end{array} right] } } & { { { begin{array} { l l l l } { } } & { } & { }  { { mathsf { I } } } & { } & { } & { } end{array} } }  { { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { { mathsf { M A M E } } } & { = } & { cdot } { { mathsf { L e e } } ^ { * } } & { } & { } end{array} right] } } & { { begin{array} { l l l } { } & { } & { }  { } & { } & { } & { } end{array} } }  { { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { } & { } & { } & { } end{array} right] } } & { { { begin{array} { l l l l } { } } & { } & { }  { { mathsf { I } } } & { } & { } & { } end{array} } }  { { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { } & { } & { } & { } end{array} right[ begin{array} { l l l l } { { mathsf { A D R E S S } } } & { = { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { { mathsf { M M B E R } } } & { = } & { 7 4 } & { } & { }  { } & { 5 mathsf { I R E E } } & { = } & { cdot } { mathsf { r u e ~ } } & { { mathsf { P a s c a l } } ^ { cdot } } & { { mathsf { I } } } end{array} right] } } & { } end{array}  } } & { }  { { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { } & { } & { } & { } & { }  { } & { } & { } & { } & { } end{array} right] } } & { { begin{array} { l l l } { } & { } & { }  { } & { } & { } & { } end{array} } }  { { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { } & { } & { } & { } & { } end{array} right] } & { { begin{array} { l l l } { mathsf { I } } & { } & { } end{array} } } end{array} } } end{right]array} } end{array}$ \nWhat happens when we augment Kim’s address with a specification for CITY? Notice that fs1 needs to include the whole path from the root of the feature structure down to CITY. \nBy contrast, the result is very different if fs1 is unified with the structure sharing version fs2 (also shown earlier as the graph (24)): \n>>> fs2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FeatStruct(\"\"\"[NAME=Lee, ADDRESS=(1)[NUMBER $: = 7 4$ , STREET $mathbf { bar { rho } } = mathbf { rho }$ 'rue Pascal'], SPOUSE $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ [NAME $ c =$ Kim, ADDRESS->(1)]]\"\"\")   \n>>> print fs1.unify(fs2)   \n$begin{array}{c} begin{array}{c} begin{array}{c} begin{array} { r l r } & { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } & & { cdot } & { cdot }  & { cdot } & & { cdot } end{array} right] }  & { left[ begin{array} { l } { { texttt { A D D R E S S } } = texttt { ( 1 ) } left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { texttt { C T Y } } & { = } & { cdot } end{array} right] } & {  } & { }  & { left[ begin{array} { l } { { texttt { A U M B E R - ( 7 4 ) } } } & { = } & { cdot } end{array} right] } & { big ] }  & { left[ begin{array} { l l l l } { big [ } & { } & { big [ } & { } end{array} right] } & { big ] } & { }  & { big [ } & { big [ } & { big [ } end{array} texttt { texttt { S T R E F - ( ' 5 a c e ~ P a s c a l ~ ' ~ lfloor ~ } big ] } & { big ] } & { big ] }  & { big [ } & { big [ } & { big [ } end{array} big ] }  & right]{ big [ begin{array} { l } { { texttt { A u m - \" L e e } } } & { big ] } & { big ] } & { }  { big [ } & { } & { big [ } end{array} big ] } & { big ] }  & { left[ begin{array} { l } { { texttt { S P O U S E - ( 7 4 ) } } } & { = } & { big [ } & { big [ }  { } & { big [ } & { big [ } end{array} texttt { texttt { A l f - ( 7 4 ) } } right]} end{array}   & { big ] } & { big ] }  & { left[ begin{array} { l } { { texttt { I } } } & { = } & { big [ } & { big [ } end{array} texttt { texttt { N A l f - ( 7 4 ) } } big ] right]} & { big ] } end{array}   & { } end{array}$ \nRather than just updating what was in effect Kim’s “copy” of Lee’s address, we have now updated both their addresses at the same time.

This allowed us to write productions like the following: \n(29) VP -> IV VP -> TV NP \nAlthough we know that IV and TV are two kinds of V, they are just atomic non-terminal symbols in a CFG and are as distinct from each other as any other pair of symbols. This notation doesn’t let us say anything about verbs in general; e.g., we cannot say “All lexical items of category $mathsf { V }$ can be marked for tense,” since walk, say, is an item of category IV, not V. So, can we replace category labels such as TV and IV by V along with a feature that tells us whether the verb combines with a following NP object or whether it can occur without any complement? \nA simple approach, originally developed for a grammar framework called Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG), tries to solve this problem by allowing lexical categories to bear a SUBCAT feature, which tells us what subcategorization class the item belongs to. In contrast to the integer values for SUBCAT used by GPSG, the example here adopts more mnemonic values, namely intrans, trans, and clause: \n(30) VP[TENSE=?t, NUM $cdot = ? n$ ] -> V[SUBCAT $mathbf { bar { rho } } = mathbf { rho }$ intrans, $T E N S E = ? t$ , NUM $| = ? n$ ] VP[TENSE $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ?t, NUM $mid =$ ?n] -> V[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ trans, $T E N S E = ? t$ , NUM=?n] NP VP[TENSE=?t, NUM $| = ? |$ n] -> V[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ clause, TENSE $ c =$ ?t, NUM $| = ? n$ ] SBar V[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ intrans, TENSE $dot { bf { theta } } = dot { bf { theta } }$ pres, NUM $vDash$ sg] -> 'disappears' | 'walks' V[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ trans, TENSE $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ pres, NUM $vDash$ sg] -> 'sees' | 'likes' V[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ clause, TENSE $ c =$ pres, NUM=sg] -> 'says' | 'claims' V[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ intrans, TENSE $ c =$ pres, NUM=pl] -> 'disappear' | 'walk' V[SUBCAT=trans, TENSE=pres, NUM=pl] -> 'see' | 'like' V[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ clause, TENSE $ c =$ pres, NUM=pl] -> 'say' | 'claim' V[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ intrans, TENSE $dot { bf { theta } } = { bf theta }$ past] -> 'disappeared' | 'walked' V[SUBCAT=trans, TENSE=past] -> 'saw' | 'liked' V[SUBCAT=clause, TENSE=past] -> 'said' | 'claimed' \nWhen we see a lexical category like V[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ trans], we can interpret the SUBCAT specification as a pointer to a production in which V[SUBCAT $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ trans] is introduced as the head child in a VP production. By convention, there is a correspondence between the values of SUBCAT and the productions that introduce lexical heads. On this approach, SUBCAT can appear only on lexical categories; it makes no sense, for example, to specify a SUBCAT value on VP. As required, walk and like both belong to the category V. Nevertheless, walk will occur only in VPs expanded by a production with the feature SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ intrans on the righthand side, as opposed to like, which requires a SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ trans. \nIn our third class of verbs in (30), we have specified a category SBar. This is a label for subordinate clauses, such as the complement of claim in the example You claim that you like children. We require two further productions to analyze such sentences: \n(31) SBar -> Comp S Comp -> 'that' \nThe resulting structure is the following. \nAn alternative treatment of subcategorization, due originally to a framework known as categorial grammar, is represented in feature-based frameworks such as PATR and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar. Rather than using SUBCAT values as a way of indexing productions, the SUBCAT value directly encodes the valency of a head (the list of arguments that it can combine with). For example, a verb like put that takes NP and PP complements (put the book on the table) might be represented as (33): \nThis says that the verb can combine with three arguments. The leftmost element in the list is the subject NP, while everything else—an NP followed by a PP in this case—comprises the subcategorized-for complements. When a verb like put is combined with appropriate complements, the requirements which are specified in the SUBCAT are discharged, and only a subject NP is needed. This category, which corresponds to what is traditionally thought of as VP, might be represented as follows: \n(34) V[SUBCAT=<NP>] \nFinally, a sentence is a kind of verbal category that has no requirements for further arguments, and hence has a SUBCAT whose value is the empty list. The tree (35) shows how these category assignments combine in a parse of Kim put the book on the table. \nHeads Revisited \nWe noted in the previous section that by factoring subcategorization information out of the main category label, we could express more generalizations about properties of verbs. Another property of this kind is the following: expressions of category V are heads of phrases of category VP. Similarly, Ns are heads of NPs, As (i.e., adjectives) are heads of APs, and Ps (i.e., prepositions) are heads of PPs. Not all phrases have heads—for example, it is standard to say that coordinate phrases (e.g., the book and the bell) lack heads. Nevertheless, we would like our grammar formalism to express the parent/head-child relation where it holds. At present, $mathsf { v }$ and VP are just atomic symbols, and we need to find a way to relate them using features (as we did earlier to relate IV and TV). \nX-bar syntax addresses this issue by abstracting out the notion of phrasal level. It is usual to recognize three such levels. If N represents the lexical level, then N' represents the next level up, corresponding to the more traditional category Nom, and N'' represents the phrasal level, corresponding to the category NP.

        "content": "Heads Revisited \nWe noted in the previous section that by factoring subcategorization information out of the main category label, we could express more generalizations about properties of verbs. Another property of this kind is the following: expressions of category V are heads of phrases of category VP. Similarly, Ns are heads of NPs, As (i.e., adjectives) are heads of APs, and Ps (i.e., prepositions) are heads of PPs. Not all phrases have heads—for example, it is standard to say that coordinate phrases (e.g., the book and the bell) lack heads. Nevertheless, we would like our grammar formalism to express the parent/head-child relation where it holds. At present, $mathsf { v }$ and VP are just atomic symbols, and we need to find a way to relate them using features (as we did earlier to relate IV and TV). \nX-bar syntax addresses this issue by abstracting out the notion of phrasal level. It is usual to recognize three such levels. If N represents the lexical level, then N' represents the next level up, corresponding to the more traditional category Nom, and N'' represents the phrasal level, corresponding to the category NP. (36a) illustrates a representative structure, while (36b) is the more conventional counterpart. \nThe head of the structure (36a) is N, and $mathsf { N } ^ { prime }$ and N'' are called (phrasal) projections of N. N'' is the maximal projection, and N is sometimes called the zero projection. One of the central claims of X-bar syntax is that all constituents share a structural similarity. Using X as a variable over N, V, A, and P, we say that directly subcategorized complements of a lexical head X are always placed as siblings of the head, whereas adjuncts are placed as siblings of the intermediate category, $x ^ { prime }$ . Thus, the configuration of the two ${ mathsf { P } } ^ { prime prime }$ adjuncts in (37) contrasts with that of the complement ${ sf P ^ { prime prime } }$ in (36a). \nThe productions in (38) illustrate how bar levels can be encoded using feature structures. The nested structure in (37) is achieved by two applications of the recursive rule expanding N $scriptstyle left[ B A R = 1 right]$ . \nAuxiliary Verbs and Inversion \nInverted clauses—where the order of subject and verb is switched—occur in English interrogatives and also after “negative” adverbs: \n(39) a. Do you like children? b. Can Jody walk?   \n(40) a. Rarely do you see Kim. b. Never have I seen this dog. \nHowever, we cannot place just any verb in pre-subject position: \n(41) a. *Like you children? b. *Walks Jody?   \n(42) a. *Rarely see you Kim. b. *Never saw I this dog. \nVerbs that can be positioned initially in inverted clauses belong to the class known as auxiliaries, and as well as do, can, and have include be, will, and shall.

Which card do you put __ into the slot? b. Which slot do you put the card into __? \nSo, a gap can occur if it is licensed by a filler. Conversely, fillers can occur only if there is an appropriate gap elsewhere in the sentence, as shown by the following examples: \n(50) a. *Kim knows who you like Jody. b. *This music, you really like hip-hop.   \n(51) a. *Which card do you put this into the slot? b. *Which slot do you put the card into this one? \nThe mutual co-occurrence between filler and gap is sometimes termed a “dependency.” One issue of considerable importance in theoretical linguistics has been the nature of the material that can intervene between a filler and the gap that it licenses; in particular, can we simply list a finite set of sequences that separate the two? The answer is no: there is no upper bound on the distance between filler and gap. This fact can be easily illustrated with constructions involving sentential complements, as shown in (52). \n(52) a. Who do you like __? b. Who do you claim that you like __? c. Who do you claim that Jody says that you like __? \nSince we can have indefinitely deep recursion of sentential complements, the gap can be embedded indefinitely far inside the whole sentence. This constellation of properties leads to the notion of an unbounded dependency construction, that is, a filler-gap dependency where there is no upper bound on the distance between filler and gap. \nA variety of mechanisms have been suggested for handling unbounded dependencies in formal grammars; here we illustrate the approach due to Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar that involves slash categories. A slash category has the form Y/XP; we interpret this as a phrase of category Y that is missing a subconstituent of category XP. For example, S/NP is an S that is missing an NP. The use of slash categories is illustrated in (53). \nThe top part of the tree introduces the filler who (treated as an expression of category ${ mathsf { N P } } [ mathsf { + w h } ] ,$ together with a corresponding gap-containing constituent S/NP. The gap information is then “percolated” down the tree via the VP/NP category, until it reaches the category NP/NP. At this point, the dependency is discharged by realizing the gap information as the empty string, immediately dominated by NP/NP. \n\nDo we need to think of slash categories as a completely new kind of object? Fortunately, we can accommodate them within our existing feature-based framework, by treating slash as a feature and the category to its right as a value; that is, S/NP is reducible to $S [ S L A S H = N P ]$ . In practice, this is also how the parser interprets slash categories. \nThe grammar shown in Example 9-3 illustrates the main principles of slash categories, and also includes productions for inverted clauses. To simplify presentation, we have omitted any specification of tense on the verbs. \nExample 9-3. Grammar with productions for inverted clauses and long-distance dependencies, making use of slash categories. \n>>> nltk.data.show_cfg('grammars/book_grammars/feat1.fcfg')   \n% start S   \n# ###################   \n# Grammar Productions   \n# ###################   \nS[-INV] -> NP VP   \nS[-INV]/?x -> NP VP/?x   \nS[-INV] -> NP S/NP   \nS[-INV] -> Adv[+NEG] S[+INV]   \n${ mathsf { S } } { mathsf { [ { + } { bar { Delta } } N V ] } }  { mathsf { Sigma } } to  { mathsf { V } } { mathsf { [ { + } { bar { Delta } } U X ] } }$ NP VP   \n$5 [ + mathrm { I N V } ] / 2 times ~  ~ mathsf { V } [ + mathsf { A U X } ] ~ mathsf { N P } ~ mathsf { V P } / gim _ { X }$   \nSBar -> Comp S[-INV]   \nSBar/?x -> Comp S[-INV]/?x   \nVP -> V[SUBCAT=intrans, -AUX]   \nVP -> V[SUBCAT=trans, -AUX] NP   \nVP/?x -> V[SUBCAT $mathbf { bar { rho } } = mathbf { rho }$ trans, -AUX] NP/?x   \nVP $$ V[SUBCAT $dot { bf { theta } } = { bf { theta } }$ clause, -AUX] SBar   \nVP/?x -> V[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ clause, -AUX] SBar/?x   \nVP -> V[+AUX] VP   \nVP/?x -> V[+AUX] VP/?x   \n# ###################   \n# Lexical Productions   \n# ###################   \nV[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ intrans, -AUX] -> 'walk' | 'sing'   \nV[SUBCAT $dot { bf Phi } = bf Phi $ trans, -AUX] -> 'see' | 'like'   \nV[SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ clause, -AUX] -> 'say' | 'claim'   \nV[+AUX] -> 'do' | 'can'   \nNP[-WH] -> 'you' | 'cats'   \nNP[+WH] -> 'who'   \nAdv[+NEG] -> 'rarely' | 'never'   \nNP/NP ->   \nComp -> 'that' \nThe grammar in Example 9-3 contains one “gap-introduction” production, namely S[- INV] -> NP S/NP. In order to percolate the slash feature correctly, we need to add slashes with variable values to both sides of the arrow in productions that expand S, VP, and NP. For example, $mathsf { V P } / ? mathsf { x _ } mathsf { searrow } mathsf { V } mathsf { mathsf {  I B a r / ? } x }$ is the slashed version of VP -> V SBar and says that a slash value can be specified on the VP parent of a constituent if the same value is also specified on the SBar child. Finally, NP/NP -> allows the slash information on NP to be discharged as the empty string. Using the grammar in Example 9-3, we can parse the sequence who do you claim that you like: \n\n>>> tokens $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'who do you claim that you like'.split()   \n>>> from nltk import load_parser   \n>>> cp $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ load_parser('grammars/book_grammars/feat1.fcfg')   \n$gg >$ for tree in cp.nbest_parse(tokens): print tree   \n(S[-INV] (NP[+WH] who) (S[+INV]/NP[] (V[+AUX] do) (NP[-WH] you) (VP[]/NP[] (V[-AUX, SUBCAT='clause'] claim) (SBar[]/NP[] (Comp[] that) (S[-INV]/NP[] (NP[-WH] you) (VP[]/NP[] (V[-AUX, SUBCAT $dot { mathbf { eta } } = mathbf { eta }$ 'trans'] like) (NP[]/NP[] ))))))) \nA more readable version of this tree is shown in (54). \nThe grammar in Example 9-3 will also allow us to parse sentences without gaps: \n>>> tokens $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'you claim that you like cats'.split()   \n>>> for tree in cp.nbest_parse(tokens): print tree   \n(S[-INV] (NP[-WH] you) (VP[] (V[-AUX, SUBCAT='clause'] claim) (SBar[] (Comp[] that) (S[-INV] (NP[-WH] you) (VP[] (V[-AUX, SUBCAT='trans'] like) (NP[-WH] cats)))))) \nIn addition, it admits inverted sentences that do not involve wh constructions: \n>>> tokens $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'rarely do you sing'.split()   \n>>> for tree in cp.nbest_parse(tokens): print tree   \n(S[-INV] (Adv $[ + N E G ]$ rarely) $( S [ + mathtt { I N V } ]$ (V[+AUX] do) (NP[-WH] you) (VP[] (V[-AUX, SUBCAT='intrans'] sing)))) \nCase and Gender in German \nCompared with English, German has a relatively rich morphology for agreement.

An important motivation was to capture generalizations across classes of segments, for example, that /n/ gets realized as $' mathrm { m } /$ preceding any +labial consonant. Within Chomskyan grammar, it was standard to use atomic features for phenomena such as agreement, and also to capture generalizations across syntactic categories, by analogy with phonology.

Early work in Lexical-Functional grammar (LFG; [Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982]) introduced the notion of an f-structure that was primarily intended to represent the grammatical relations and predicate-argument structure associated with a constituent structure parse. (Shieber, 1986) provides an excellent introduction to this phase of research into feature-based grammars. \nOne conceptual difficulty with algebraic approaches to feature structures arose when researchers attempted to model negation. An alternative perspective, pioneered by (Kasper & Rounds, 1986) and (Johnson, 1988), argues that grammars involve descriptions of feature structures rather than the structures themselves. These descriptions are combined using logical operations such as conjunction, and negation is just the usual logical operation over feature descriptions. This description-oriented perspective was integral to LFG from the outset (Kaplan, 1989), and was also adopted by later versions of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; [Sag & Wasow, 1999]). A comprehensive bibliography of HPSG literature can be found at http://www.cl.uni-bremen .de/HPSG-Bib/. \nFeature structures, as presented in this chapter, are unable to capture important constraints on linguistic information.

For example, the present tense conjugation of the lexeme walk has only two distinct forms: walks for the third-person singular, and walk for all other combinations of person and number. A successful analysis should not require redundantly specifying that five out of the six possible morphological combinations have the same realization. Propose and implement a method for dealing with this.   \n14. ● So-called head features are shared between the parent node and head child. For example, TENSE is a head feature that is shared between a VP and its head V child. See (Gazdar et al., 1985) for more details. Most of the features we have looked at are head features—exceptions are SUBCAT and SLASH. Since the sharing of head features is predictable, it should not need to be stated explicitly in the grammar productions. Develop an approach that automatically accounts for this regular behavior of head features.   \n15. $bullet$ Extend NLTK’s treatment of feature structures to allow unification into listvalued features, and use this to implement an HPSG-style analysis of subcategorization, whereby the SUBCAT of a head category is the concatenation of its complements’ categories with the SUBCAT value of its immediate parent.   \n16. $bullet$ Extend NLTK’s treatment of feature structures to allow productions with underspecified categories, such as $S [ - mathrm { I N V } ] to ? times mathsf { S } / ? times$ .   \n17. $bullet$ Extend NLTK’s treatment of feature structures to allow typed feature structures.   \n18. $bullet$ Pick some grammatical constructions described in (Huddleston & Pullum,   \n2002), and develop a feature-based grammar to account for them. \nAnalyzing the Meaning of Sentences \nWe have seen how useful it is to harness the power of a computer to process text on a large scale.

In this section, we will show that solving the task in a restricted domain is pretty straightforward. But we will also see that to address the problem in a more general way, we have to open up a whole new box of ideas and techniques, involving the representation of meaning. \nSo let’s start off by assuming that we have data about cities and countries in a structured form. To be concrete, we will use a database table whose first few rows are shown in Table 10-1. \nThe data illustrated in Table 10-1 is drawn from the Chat-80 system (Warren & Pereira, 1982). Population figures are given in thousands, but note that the data used in these examples dates back at least to the 1980s, and was already somewhat out of date at the point when (Warren & Pereira, 1982) was published. \nThe obvious way to retrieve answers from this tabular data involves writing queries in a database query language such as SQL. \nSQL (Structured Query Language) is a language designed for retrieving and managing data in relational databases. If you want to find out more about SQL, http://www.w3schools.com/sql/ is a convenient online reference. \nFor example, executing the query (2) will pull out the value 'greece': \n(2) SELECT Country FROM city_table WHERE City $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'athens' \nThis specifies a result set consisting of all values for the column Country in data rows where the value of the City column is 'athens'. \nHow can we get the same effect using English as our input to the query system? The feature-based grammar formalism described in Chapter 9 makes it easy to translate from English to SQL. The grammar sql0.fcfg illustrates how to assemble a meaning representation for a sentence in tandem with parsing the sentence. Each phrase structure rule is supplemented with a recipe for constructing a value for the feature SEM. You can see that these recipes are extremely simple; in each case, we use the string concatenation operation $^ +$ to splice the values for the child constituents to make a value for the parent constituent. \n>>> nltk.data.show_cfg('grammars/book_grammars/sql0.fcfg')   \n$%$ start S   \nS[SEM=(?np + WHERE + ?vp)] -> NP[SEM=?np] VP[SEM=?vp]   \n$forall P lceil S E M = ( 2 v + 2 v 0 ) rceil  mathbb { I V } lceil S E M = 2 v rceil mathsf { P P } lceil S E M = 2 v 0 rceil$   \n$mathsf { V P } left[ mathsf { S E M } = left( mathsf { Z v ~ + ~ mathsf { ? } a p } right) right] ~ to ~ mathsf { I V } left[ mathsf { S E M } = mathsf { ? v } right] ~ mathsf { A P } left[ mathsf { S E M = ? a p } right]$   \nNP[SEM=(?det + ?n)] -> Det[SEM=?det] N[SEM=?n]   \nPP[SEM=(?p + ?np)] -> P[SEM=?p] NP[SEM=?np]   \nAP[SEM=?pp] -> A[SEM=?a] PP[SEM=?pp]   \nNP[SEM='Country=\"greece\"'] -> 'Greece'   \nNP[SEM='Country $mathbf { bar { rho } } = mathbf { rho }$ \"china\"'] -> 'China'   \nDet[SEM='SELECT'] -> 'Which' | 'What'   \nN[SEM='City FROM city_table'] -> 'cities'   \nIV[SEM=''] -> 'are'   \nA[SEM=''] -> 'located'   \n$P [ S E M = \" ]  \" =$ in' \nThis allows us to parse a query into SQL: \n>>> from nltk import load_parser   \n>>> cp $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ load_parser('grammars/book_grammars/sql0.fcfg')   \n$gg >$ query $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'What cities are located in China'   \n>>> trees $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ cp.nbest_parse(query.split())   \n$gg >$ answer $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ trees[0].node['sem']   \n> $> >  q  =  \"  \"$ .join(answer)   \n>>> print $mathsf { q }$   \nSELECT City FROM city_table WHERE Country=\"china\" \nYour Turn: Run the parser with maximum tracing on, i.e., $mathsf { c p } ^ { mathrm { ~ tiny ~ = ~ } }$ load_parser('grammars/book_grammars/sql0.fcfg', trace $^ { = 3 }$ ), and examine how the values of SEM are built up as complete edges are added to the chart. \nFinally, we execute the query over the database city.db and retrieve some results: \n>>> from nltk.sem import chat80   \n$gg > >$ rows $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ chat80.sql_query('corpora/city_database/city.db', q)   \n>>> for r in rows: print r[0],   \ncanton chungking dairen harbin kowloon mukden peking shanghai sian tientsin \nSince each row r is a one-element tuple, we print out the member of the tuple rather than the tuple itself $bullet$ . \nTo summarize, we have defined a task where the computer returns useful data in response to a natural language query, and we implemented this by translating a small subset of English into SQL. We can say that our NLTK code already “understands” SQL, given that Python is able to execute SQL queries against a database, and by extension it also “understands” queries such as What cities are located in China. This parallels being able to translate from Dutch into English as an example of natural language understanding. Suppose that you are a native speaker of English, and have started to learn Dutch. Your teacher asks if you understand what (3) means: \n(3) Margrietje houdt van Brunoke. \nIf you know the meanings of the individual words in (3), and know how these meanings are combined to make up the meaning of the whole sentence, you might say that (3) means the same as Margrietje loves Brunoke. \nAn observer—let’s call her Olga—might well take this as evidence that you do grasp the meaning of (3). But this would depend on Olga herself understanding English. If she doesn’t, then your translation from Dutch to English is not going to convince her of your ability to understand Dutch. We will return to this issue shortly. \nThe grammar sql0.fcfg, together with the NLTK Earley parser, is instrumental in carrying out the translation from English to SQL. How adequate is this grammar? You saw that the SQL translation for the whole sentence was built up from the translations of the components. However, there does not seem to be a lot of justification for these component meaning representations. For example, if we look at the analysis of the noun phrase Which cities, the determiner and noun correspond respectively to the SQL fragments SELECT and City FROM city_table. But neither of these has a well-defined meaning in isolation from the other. \nThere is another criticism we can level at the grammar: we have “hard-wired” an embarrassing amount of detail about the database into it. We need to know the name of the relevant table (e.g., city_table) and the names of the fields. But our database could have contained exactly the same rows of data yet used a different table name and different field names, in which case the SQL queries would not be executable. Equally, we could have stored our data in a different format, such as XML, in which case retrieving the same results would require us to translate our English queries into an XML query language rather than SQL. These considerations suggest that we should be translating English into something that is more abstract and generic than SQL. \nIn order to sharpen the point, let’s consider another English query and its translation: \n(4) a. What cities are in China and have populations above 1,000,000? b. SELECT City FROM city_table WHERE Country $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ 'china' AND Population > 1000 \nYour Turn: Extend the grammar sql0.fcfg so that it will translate (4a) into (4b), and check the values returned by the query. Remember that figures in the Chat-80 database are given in thousands, hence 1000 in (4b) represents one million inhabitants. \nYou will probably find it easiest to first extend the grammar to handle queries like What cities have populations above 1,000,000 before tackling conjunction. After you have had a go at this task, you can compare your solution to grammars/book_grammars/sql1.fcfg in the NLTK data distribution. \nObserve that the and conjunction in (4a) is translated into an AND in the SQL counterpart, (4b). The latter tells us to select results from rows where two conditions are true together: the value of the Country column is 'china' and the value of the Population column is greater than 1000. This interpretation for and involves a new idea: it talks about what is true in some particular situation, and tells us that Cond1 AND Cond2 is true in situation $s$ if and only if condition Cond1 is true in s and condition Cond2 is true in s. Although this doesn’t account for the full range of meanings of and in English, it has the nice property that it is independent of any query language. In fact, we have given it the standard interpretation from classical logic. In the following sections, we will explore an approach in which sentences of natural language are translated into logic instead of an executable query language such as SQL. One advantage of logical formalisms is that they are more abstract and therefore more generic. If we wanted to, once we had our translation into logic, we could then translate it into various other special-purpose languages. In fact, most serious attempts to query databases via natural language have used this methodology. \nNatural Language, Semantics, and Logic \nWe started out trying to capture the meaning of (1a) by translating it into a query in another language, SQL, which the computer could interpret and execute. But this still begged the question whether the translation was correct. Stepping back from database query, we noted that the meaning of and seems to depend on being able to specify when statements are true or not in a particular situation. Instead of translating a sentence S from one language to another, we try to say what S is about by relating it to a situation in the world. Let’s pursue this further. Imagine there is a situation s where there are two entities, Margrietje and her favorite doll, Brunoke. In addition, there is a relation holding between the two entities, which we will call the love relation. If you understand the meaning of (3), then you know that it is true in situation s. In part, you know this because you know that Margrietje refers to Margrietje, Brunoke refers to Brunoke, and houdt van refers to the love relation. \nWe have introduced two fundamental notions in semantics. The first is that declarative sentences are true or false in certain situations. The second is that definite noun phrases and proper nouns refer to things in the world. So (3) is true in a situation where Margrietje loves the doll Brunoke, here illustrated in Figure 10-1. \nOnce we have adopted the notion of truth in a situation, we have a powerful tool for reasoning. In particular, we can look at sets of sentences, and ask whether they could be true together in some situation. For example, the sentences in (5) can be both true, whereas those in (6) and (7) cannot be. In other words, the sentences in (5) are consistent, whereas those in (6) and (7) are inconsistent. \n(5) a. Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia. b. Freedonia is a republic.",

Freedonia is to the north of Sylvania. \nWe have chosen sentences about fictional countries (featured in the Marx Brothers’ 1933 movie Duck Soup) to emphasize that your ability to reason about these examples does not depend on what is true or false in the actual world. If you know the meaning of the word no, and also know that the capital of a country is a city in that country, then you should be able to conclude that the two sentences in (6) are inconsistent, regardless of where Freedonia is or what the population of its capital is. That is, there’s no possible situation in which both sentences could be true. Similarly, if you know that the relation expressed by to the north of is asymmetric, then you should be able to conclude that the two sentences in (7) are inconsistent. \nBroadly speaking, logic-based approaches to natural language semantics focus on those aspects of natural language that guide our judgments of consistency and inconsistency. The syntax of a logical language is designed to make these features formally explicit. As a result, determining properties like consistency can often be reduced to symbolic manipulation, that is, to a task that can be carried out by a computer. In order to pursue this approach, we first want to develop a technique for representing a possible situation. We do this in terms of something that logicians call a “model.” \nA model for a set $W$ of sentences is a formal representation of a situation in which all the sentences in $W$ are true. The usual way of representing models involves set theory. The domain $D$ of discourse (all the entities we currently care about) is a set of individuals, while relations are treated as sets built up from $D$ . Let’s look at a concrete example. Our domain $D$ will consist of three children, Stefan, Klaus, and Evi, represented respectively as s, k, and e. We write this as $D = { mathsf { s } , ~ mathsf { k } , ~ mathsf { e } }$ . The expression boy denotes the set consisting of Stefan and Klaus, the expression girl denotes the set consisting of Evi, and the expression is running denotes the set consisting of Stefan and Evi. Figure 10-2 is a graphical rendering of the model. \nLater in this chapter we will use models to help evaluate the truth or falsity of English sentences, and in this way to illustrate some methods for representing meaning. However, before going into more detail, let’s put the discussion into a broader perspective, and link back to a topic that we briefly raised in Section 1.5. Can a computer understand the meaning of a sentence? And how could we tell if it did? This is similar to asking “Can a computer think?” Alan Turing famously proposed to answer this by examining the ability of a computer to hold sensible conversations with a human (Turing, 1950). Suppose you are having a chat session with a person and a computer, but you are not told at the outset which is which. If you cannot identify which of your partners is the computer after chatting with each of them, then the computer has successfully imitated a human. If a computer succeeds in passing itself off as human in this “imitation game” (or “Turing Test” as it is popularly known), then according to Turing, we should be prepared to say that the computer can think and can be said to be intelligent. So Turing side-stepped the question of somehow examining the internal states of a computer by instead using its behavior as evidence of intelligence. By the same reasoning, we have assumed that in order to say that a computer understands English, it just needs to behave as though it did. What is important here is not so much the specifics of Turing’s imitation game, but rather the proposal to judge a capacity for natural language understanding in terms of observable behavior. \n\n10.2  Propositional Logic \nA logical language is designed to make reasoning formally explicit. As a result, it can capture aspects of natural language which determine whether a set of sentences is consistent. As part of this approach, we need to develop logical representations of a sentence $varphi$ that formally capture the truth-conditions of $varphi$ . We’ll start off with a simple example: \n(8) [Klaus chased Evi] and [Evi ran away]. \nLet’s replace the two sub-sentences in (8) by $varphi$ and $psi$ respectively, and put $&$ for the logical operator corresponding to the English word and: $$ 84$ . This structure is the logical form of (8). \nPropositional logic allows us to represent just those parts of linguistic structure that correspond to certain sentential connectives. We have just looked at and. Other such connectives are not, or, and if..., then.... In the formalization of propositional logic, the counterparts of such connectives are sometimes called Boolean operators. The basic expressions of propositional logic are propositional symbols, often written as $P$ , $ Q ,$ $R$ , etc. There are varying conventions for representing Boolean operators. Since we will be focusing on ways of exploring logic within NLTK, we will stick to the following ASCII versions of the operators: \n>>> nltk.boolean_ops() negation conjunction & disjunction | implication -> equivalence <-> \nFrom the propositional symbols and the Boolean operators we can build an infinite set of well-formed formulas (or just formulas, for short) of propositional logic. First, every propositional letter is a formula. Then if $varphi$ is a formula, so is $- Phi$ . And if $varphi$ and $psi$ are formulas, then so are $( Phi & Psi )$ , $( varphi mid psi )$ , $( varphi to Psi )$ , and $( Phi < cdot > Psi )$ . \nTable 10-2 specifies the truth-conditions for formulas containing these operators. As before we use $varphi$ and $psi$ as variables over sentences, and abbreviate if and only if as iff.",

As before we use $varphi$ and $psi$ as variables over sentences, and abbreviate if and only if as iff. \nThese rules are generally straightforward, though the truth conditions for implication depart in many cases from our usual intuitions about the conditional in English. A formula of the form $( { mathsf { P } }    { mathsf { Q } } )$ is false only when P is true and Q is false. If P is false (say, P corresponds to The moon is made of green cheese) and Q is true (say, Q corresponds to Two plus two equals four), then $textsf { P } to textsf { Q }$ will come out true. \nNLTK’s LogicParser() parses logical expressions into various subclasses of Expression: \nFrom a computational perspective, logics give us an important tool for performing inference. Suppose you state that Freedonia is not to the north of Sylvania, and you give as your reasons that Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia. In this case, you have produced an argument. The sentence Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia is the assumption of the argument, while Freedonia is not to the north of Sylvania is the conclusion. The step of moving from one or more assumptions to a conclusion is called inference. Informally, it is common to write arguments in a format where the conclusion is preceded by therefore. \n(9) Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia. Therefore, Freedonia is not to the north of Sylvania. \nAn argument is valid if there is no possible situation in which its premises are all true and its conclusion is not true. \nNow, the validity of (9) crucially depends on the meaning of the phrase to the north of, in particular, the fact that it is an asymmetric relation: \n(10) if $x$ is to the north of $y$ then $y$ is not to the north of $x$ \nUnfortunately, we can’t express such rules in propositional logic: the smallest elements we have to play with are atomic propositions, and we cannot “look inside” these to talk about relations between individuals $x$ and $y$ . The best we can do in this case is capture a particular case of the asymmetry. Let’s use the propositional symbol SnF to stand for Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia and FnS for Freedonia is to the north of Sylvania. To say that Freedonia is not to the north of Sylvania, we write -FnS. That is, we treat not as equivalent to the phrase it is not the case that ..., and translate this as the one-place Boolean operator -. Replacing $x$ and $y$ in (10) by Sylvania and Freedonia respectively gives us an implication that can be written as: \n\nHow about giving a version of the complete argument? We will replace the first sentence of (9) by two formulas of propositional logic: SnF, and also the implication in (11), which expresses (rather poorly) our background knowledge of the meaning of to the north of. We’ll write [A1, ..., An] / C to represent the argument that conclusion C follows from assumptions [A1, ..., An]. This leads to the following as a representation of argument (9): \n(12) [SnF, SnF -> -FnS] / -FnS \nThis is a valid argument: if SnF and SnF -> -FnS are both true in a situation s, then -FnS must also be true in s. By contrast, if FnS were true, this would conflict with our understanding that two objects cannot both be to the north of each other in any possible situation. Equivalently, the list [SnF, SnF -> -FnS, FnS] is inconsistent—these sentences cannot all be true together. \nArguments can be tested for “syntactic validity” by using a proof system. We will say a little bit more about this later on in Section 10.3. Logical proofs can be carried out with NLTK’s inference module, for example, via an interface to the third-party theorem prover Prover9. The inputs to the inference mechanism first have to be parsed into logical expressions by LogicParser(). \n>>> lp $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.LogicParser() >>> SnF $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ lp.parse('SnF') >>> NotFnS $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ lp.parse('-FnS') >>> R $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ lp.parse('SnF -> -FnS') $gg >$ prover $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Prover9() >>> prover.prove(NotFnS, [SnF, R]) True \nHere’s another way of seeing why the conclusion follows. SnF -> -FnS is semantically equivalent to -SnF | -FnS, where | is the two-place operator corresponding to or. In general, $varphi mid psi$ is true in a situation $s$ if either $varphi$ is true in $s$ or $boldsymbol { Phi }$ is true in s. Now, suppose both SnF and -SnF | -FnS are true in situation s. If SnF is true, then -SnF cannot also be true; a fundamental assumption of classical logic is that a sentence cannot be both true and false in a situation. Consequently, -FnS must be true. \nRecall that we interpret sentences of a logical language relative to a model, which is a very simplified version of the world. A model for propositional logic needs to assign the values True or False to every possible formula. We do this inductively: first, every propositional symbol is assigned a value, and then we compute the value of complex formulas by consulting the meanings of the Boolean operators (i.e., Table 10-2) and applying them to the values of the formula’s components. A Valuation is a mapping from basic symbols of the logic to their values. Here’s an example: \n\n>>> val $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Valuation([('P', True), ('Q', True), ('R', False)]) \nWe initialize a Valuation with a list of pairs, each of which consists of a semantic symbol and a semantic value. The resulting object is essentially just a dictionary that maps logical symbols (treated as strings) to appropriate values. \n>>> val['P'] True \nAs we will see later, our models need to be somewhat more complicated in order to handle the more complex logical forms discussed in the next section; for the time being, just ignore the dom and g parameters in the following declarations. \nNow let’s initialize a model m that uses val: \nEvery model comes with an evaluate() method, which will determine the semantic value of logical expressions, such as formulas of propositional logic; of course, these values depend on the initial truth values we assigned to propositional symbols such as P, Q, and R. \n>>> print m.evaluate('(P & Q)', g) True   \n>>> print m.evaluate('-(P & Q)', g) False   \n>>> print m.evaluate('(P & R)', g) False   \n>>> print m.evaluate('(P | R)', g) True \nYour Turn: Experiment with evaluating different formulas of propositional logic. Does the model give the values that you expected? \nUp until now, we have been translating our English sentences into propositional logic. Because we are confined to representing atomic sentences with letters such as P and Q, we cannot dig into their internal structure. In effect, we are saying that there is no semantic benefit in dividing atomic sentences into subjects, objects, and predicates. However, this seems wrong: if we want to formalize arguments such as (9), we have to be able to “look inside” basic sentences. As a result, we will move beyond propositional logic to something more expressive, namely first-order logic. This is what we turn to in the next section. \n10.3  First-Order Logic \nIn the remainder of this chapter, we will represent the meaning of natural language expressions by translating them into first-order logic. Not all of natural language semantics can be expressed in first-order logic. But it is a good choice for computational semantics because it is expressive enough to represent many aspects of semantics, and on the other hand, there are excellent systems available off the shelf for carrying out automated inference in first-order logic. \nOur next step will be to describe how formulas of first-order logic are constructed, and then how such formulas can be evaluated in a model. \nSyntax \nFirst-order logic keeps all the Boolean operators of propositional logic, but it adds some important new mechanisms. To start with, propositions are analyzed into predicates and arguments, which takes us a step closer to the structure of natural languages. The standard construction rules for first-order logic recognize terms such as individual variables and individual constants, and predicates that take differing numbers of arguments. For example, Angus walks might be formalized as walk(angus) and Angus sees Bertie as see(angus, bertie). We will call walk a unary predicate, and see a binary predicate. The symbols used as predicates do not have intrinsic meaning, although it is hard to remember this. Returning to one of our earlier examples, there is no logical difference between (13a) and (13b). \n(13) a. love(margrietje, brunoke) b. houden_van(margrietje, brunoke) \nBy itself, first-order logic has nothing substantive to say about lexical semantics—the meaning of individual words—although some theories of lexical semantics can be encoded in first-order logic. Whether an atomic predication like see(angus, bertie) is true or false in a situation is not a matter of logic, but depends on the particular valuation that we have chosen for the constants see, angus, and bertie. For this reason, such expressions are called non-logical constants. By contrast, logical constants (such as the Boolean operators) always receive the same interpretation in every model for first-order logic. \nWe should mention here that one binary predicate has special status, namely equality, as in formulas such as $a n g u s = a j$ . Equality is regarded as a logical constant, since for individual terms $t _ { 1 }$ and $t _ { 2 }$ , the formula $t _ { 1 } = t _ { 2 }$ is true if and only if $t _ { 1 }$ and $t _ { 2 }$ refer to one and the same entity. \nIt is often helpful to inspect the syntactic structure of expressions of first-order logic, and the usual way of doing this is to assign types to expressions. Following the tradition of Montague grammar, we will use two basic types: $e$ is the type of entities, while $t$ is the type of formulas, i.e., expressions that have truth values. Given these two basic types, we can form complex types for function expressions. That is, given any types $sigma$ and τ, $langle sigma , tau rangle$ is a complex type corresponding to functions from $mathbf { sigma } _ { mathbf { sigma } } mathbf { sigma } _ { mathbf { sigma } }$ things’ to 'τ things’. For example, $langle e , t rangle$ is the type of expressions from entities to truth values, namely unary predicates. The LogicParser can be invoked so that it carries out type checking.",

Returning to one of our earlier examples, there is no logical difference between (13a) and (13b). \n(13) a. love(margrietje, brunoke) b. houden_van(margrietje, brunoke) \nBy itself, first-order logic has nothing substantive to say about lexical semantics—the meaning of individual words—although some theories of lexical semantics can be encoded in first-order logic. Whether an atomic predication like see(angus, bertie) is true or false in a situation is not a matter of logic, but depends on the particular valuation that we have chosen for the constants see, angus, and bertie. For this reason, such expressions are called non-logical constants. By contrast, logical constants (such as the Boolean operators) always receive the same interpretation in every model for first-order logic. \nWe should mention here that one binary predicate has special status, namely equality, as in formulas such as $a n g u s = a j$ . Equality is regarded as a logical constant, since for individual terms $t _ { 1 }$ and $t _ { 2 }$ , the formula $t _ { 1 } = t _ { 2 }$ is true if and only if $t _ { 1 }$ and $t _ { 2 }$ refer to one and the same entity. \nIt is often helpful to inspect the syntactic structure of expressions of first-order logic, and the usual way of doing this is to assign types to expressions. Following the tradition of Montague grammar, we will use two basic types: $e$ is the type of entities, while $t$ is the type of formulas, i.e., expressions that have truth values. Given these two basic types, we can form complex types for function expressions. That is, given any types $sigma$ and τ, $langle sigma , tau rangle$ is a complex type corresponding to functions from $mathbf { sigma } _ { mathbf { sigma } } mathbf { sigma } _ { mathbf { sigma } }$ things’ to 'τ things’. For example, $langle e , t rangle$ is the type of expressions from entities to truth values, namely unary predicates. The LogicParser can be invoked so that it carries out type checking. \n\n>>> tlp $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.LogicParser(type_check $ c =$ True)   \n>>> parsed $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ tlp.parse('walk(angus)')   \n>>> parsed.argument   \n<ConstantExpression angus>   \n>>> parsed.argument.type   \ne   \n>>> parsed.function   \n<ConstantExpression walk>   \n>>> parsed.function.type   \n<e,?> \nWhy do we see <e, $Rsh$ at the end of this example? Although the type-checker will try to infer as many types as possible, in this case it has not managed to fully specify the type of walk, since its result type is unknown. Although we are intending walk to receive type $< e , t >$ , as far as the type-checker knows, in this context it could be of some other type, such as $< e$ , $e >$ or $< e$ , $< e , t >$ . To help the type-checker, we need to specify a signature, implemented as a dictionary that explicitly associates types with non-logical constants: \n>>> sig = {'walk': '<e, t>'}   \n>>> parsed $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ tlp.parse('walk(angus)', sig)   \n>>> parsed.function.type   \n<e,t> \nA binary predicate has type $langle e , langle e , t rangle rangle$ . Although this is the type of something which combines first with an argument of type $e$ to make a unary predicate, we represent binary predicates as combining directly with their two arguments. For example, the predicate see in the translation of Angus sees Cyril will combine with its arguments to give the result see(angus, cyril). \nIn first-order logic, arguments of predicates can also be individual variables such as $x$ , $y$ , and z. In NLTK, we adopt the convention that variables of type $e$ are all lowercase. Individual variables are similar to personal pronouns like he, she, and it, in that we need to know about the context of use in order to figure out their denotation. One way of interpreting the pronoun in (14) is by pointing to a relevant individual in the local context. \n(14) He disappeared. \nAnother way is to supply a textual antecedent for the pronoun he, for example, by uttering (15a) prior to (14). Here, we say that he is coreferential with the noun phrase Cyril. In such a context, (14) is semantically equivalent to (15b). \n(15) a. Cyril is Angus’s dog. b. Cyril disappeared. \nConsider by contrast the occurrence of he in (16a). In this case, it is bound by the indefinite NP a dog, and this is a different relationship than coreference. If we replace the pronoun he by a dog, the result (16b) is not semantically equivalent to (16a). \n(16) a. Angus had a dog but he disappeared. b. Angus had a dog but a dog disappeared. \nCorresponding to (17a), we can construct an open formula (17b) with two occurrences of the variable $x$ . (We ignore tense to simplify exposition.) \n(17) a. He is a dog and he disappeared. b. dog $( x )$ & disappear $( x )$ \nBy placing an existential quantifier $exists x$ (“for some $x ^ { prime prime }$ ) in front of (17b), we can bind these variables, as in (18a), which means (18b) or, more idiomatically, (18c). \n(18) a $. exists x . ( d o g ( mathbf { x } )  : &  : d i s a p p e a r ( x ) )$ b. At least one entity is a dog and disappeared. c. A dog disappeared. \nHere is the NLTK counterpart of (18a): \nIn addition to the existential quantifier, first-order logic offers us the universal quantifier $forall x$ (“for all $x '$ ), illustrated in (20). \n(20) a $. forall x . ( d o g ( x )  d i s a p p e a r ( x ) )$ b. Everything has the property that if it is a dog, it disappears. c. Every dog disappeared. \nHere is the NLTK counterpart of (20a): \nAlthough (20a) is the standard first-order logic translation of $( 2 0 mathrm { c } )$ , the truth conditions aren’t necessarily what you expect. The formula says that $i f$ some $x$ is a dog, then $x$ disappears—but it doesn’t say that there are any dogs. So in a situation where there are no dogs, (20a) will still come out true. (Remember that $( { mathsf { P } }    { mathsf { Q } } )$ is true when P is false.) Now you might argue that every dog disappeared does presuppose the existence of dogs, and that the logic formalization is simply wrong. But it is possible to find other examples that lack such a presupposition. For instance, we might explain that the value of the Python expression astring.replace('ate', '8') is the result of replacing every occurrence of 'ate' in astring by '8', even though there may in fact be no such occurrences (Table 3-2). \nWe have seen a number of examples where variables are bound by quantifiers. What happens in formulas such as the following? \nThe scope of the exists $mathsf { x }$ quantifier is $mathsf { d o g } ( mathsf { x } )$ , so the occurrence of $mathsf { x }$ in ${ sf b a r k } ( { sf x } )$ is unbound. Consequently it can become bound by some other quantifier, for example, all $textsf { x }$ in the next formula: \nIn general, an occurrence of a variable $mathsf { x }$ in a formula $boldsymbol { Phi }$ is free in $varphi$ if that occurrence doesn’t fall within the scope of all $mathsf { x }$ or some $mathsf { x }$ in $varphi$ . Conversely, if $mathsf { x }$ is free in formula $varphi$ , then it is bound in all $times . Phi$ and exists $times . Phi$ . If all variable occurrences in a formula are bound, the formula is said to be closed. \nWe mentioned before that the parse() method of NLTK’s LogicParser returns objects of class Expression. Each instance expr of this class comes with a method free(), which returns the set of variables that are free in expr. \nFirst-Order Theorem Proving \nRecall the constraint on to the north of, which we proposed earlier as (10): \n(22) if $x$ is to the north of $y$ then $y$ is not to the north of $x$ . \nWe observed that propositional logic is not expressive enough to represent generalizations about binary predicates, and as a result we did not properly capture the argument Sylvania is to the north of Freedonia. Therefore, Freedonia is not to the north of Sylvania. \nYou have no doubt realized that first-order logic, by contrast, is ideal for formalizing such rules: \nall x. all y.(north_of(x, y) -> -north_of(y, x)) \nEven better, we can perform automated inference to show the validity of the argument.",

First, we create a model, and then we call the evaluate() method to compute the truth value: \n>>> m $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Model(dom, val) >>> m.evaluate('see(olive, y)', g) True \nWhat’s happening here? We are evaluating a formula which is similar to our earlier example, see(olive, cyril). However, when the interpretation function encounters the variable y, rather than checking for a value in val, it asks the variable assignment g to come up with a value: \nSince we already know that individuals o and c stand in the see relation, the value True is what we expected. In this case, we can say that assignment g satisfies the formula see(olive, y). By contrast, the following formula evaluates to False relative to g (check that you see why this is). \n>>> m.evaluate('see(y, x)', g) False \nIn our approach (though not in standard first-order logic), variable assignments are partial. For example, g says nothing about any variables apart from x and y. The method purge() clears all bindings from an assignment. \n>>> g.purge()   \n>>> g   \n{} \nIf we now try to evaluate a formula such as see(olive, y) relative to $mathfrak { g }$ , it is like trying to interpret a sentence containing a him when we don’t know what him refers to. In this case, the evaluation function fails to deliver a truth value. \n>>> m.evaluate('see(olive, y)', g) 'Undefined' \nSince our models already contain rules for interpreting Boolean operators, arbitrarily complex formulas can be composed and evaluated. \n>>> m.evaluate('see(bertie, olive) & boy(bertie) & -walk(bertie)', g) True \nThe general process of determining truth or falsity of a formula in a model is called model checking. \nQuantification \nOne of the crucial insights of modern logic is that the notion of variable satisfaction can be used to provide an interpretation for quantified formulas. Let’s use (24) as an example. \nWhen is it true? Let’s think about all the individuals in our domain, i.e., in dom. We want to check whether any of these individuals has the property of being a girl and walking. In other words, we want to know if there is some $u$ in dom such that $mathtt { g } [ u / times ]$ satisfies the open formula (25). \n(25) $mathtt { g i r l ( x ) }  &  mathtt { w a l k ( x ) }$ \nConsider the following: \n>>> m.evaluate('exists x.(girl(x) & walk(x))', g) True \nevaluate() returns True here because there is some $u$ in dom such that (25) is satisfied by an assignment which binds x to $u$ . In fact, o is such a $u$ : \n>>> m.evaluate $( ^ { bullet } mathrm { g i r } 1 ( times )  &  mathsf { w a l k } ( times ) ^ { bullet } ,  mathsf { g . a d d } ( ^ { bullet } mathrm { x ^ { bullet } } ,  ^ { bullet } circ ^ { bullet } ) )$ True \nOne useful tool offered by NLTK is the satisfiers() method. This returns a set of all the individuals that satisfy an open formula. The method parameters are a parsed formula, a variable, and an assignment. Here are a few examples: \nIt’s useful to think about why fmla2 and fmla3 receive the values they do. The truth conditions for $$ mean that fmla2 is equivalent to - $- mathtt { g i r l } ( mathsf { x } )  |  mathsf { w a l k } ( mathsf { x } )$ , which is satisfied by something that either isn’t a girl or walks. Since neither b (Bertie) nor c (Cyril) are girls, according to model m, they both satisfy the whole formula. And of course o satisfies the formula because o satisfies both disjuncts. Now, since every member of the domain of discourse satisfies fmla2, the corresponding universally quantified formula is also true. \n>>> m.evaluate('all x.(girl(x) -> walk(x))', g) True",

So $mathrm { j }$ and b both admire $boldsymbol { mathsf { b } }$ (Bruce is very vain), while e admires m and m admires e. In this model, formula $( 2 7 a )$ is true but (27b) is false. One way of exploring these results is by using the satisfiers() method of Model objects. \n>>> dom2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ val2.domain   \n>>> m2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.Model(dom2, val2)   \n>>> $g 2  =$ nltk.Assignment(dom2)   \n>>> fmla4 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ lp.parse('(person(x) -> exists y.(person(y) & admire(x, y)))')   \n>>> m2.satisfiers(fmla4, 'x', g2)   \nset(['a', 'c', 'b', 'e', 'j', 'm']) \nThis shows that fmla4 holds of every individual in the domain.

By contrast, model building tries to create a new model, given some set of sentences. If it succeeds, then we know that the set is consistent, since we have an existence proof of the model. \nWe invoke the Mace4 model builder by creating an instance of Mace() and calling its build_model() method, in an analogous way to calling the Prover9 theorem prover. One option is to treat our candidate set of sentences as assumptions, while leaving the goal unspecified. The following interaction shows how both [a, c1] and [a, c2] are consistent lists, since Mace succeeds in building a model for each of them, whereas [c1, c2] is inconsistent. \n>>> a3 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ lp.parse('exists x.(man(x) & walks(x))')   \n>>> c1 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ lp.parse('mortal(socrates)')   \n>>> c2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ lp.parse('-mortal(socrates)')   \n>>> mb $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.Mace(5)   \n$gg >$ print mb.build_model(None, [a3, c1])   \nTrue   \n>>> print mb.build_model(None, [a3, c2])   \nTrue   \n>>> print mb.build_model(None, [c1, c2])   \nFalse \nWe can also use the model builder as an adjunct to the theorem prover. Let’s suppose we are trying to prove $mathsf { A } vdash mathsf { g }$ , i.e., that g is logically derivable from assumptions ${ sf A } = left[ sf { a } sf { 1 } _ { sf } { 2 } right]$ , a2, ..., an]. We can feed this same input to Mace4, and the model builder will try to find a counterexample, that is, to show that g does not follow from A. So, given this input, Mace4 will try to find a model for the assumptions A together with the negation of g, namely the list A' = [a1, a2, ..., an, -g]. If g fails to follow from S, then Mace4 may well return with a counterexample faster than Prover9 concludes that it cannot find the required proof. Conversely, if g is provable from S, Mace4 may take a long time unsuccessfully trying to find a countermodel, and will eventually give up. \nLet’s consider a concrete scenario. Our assumptions are the list [There is a woman that every man loves, Adam is a man, Eve is a woman]. Our conclusion is Adam loves Eve. Can Mace4 find a model in which the premises are true but the conclusion is false? In the following code, we use MaceCommand(), which will let us inspect the model that has been built. \n>>> a4 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ lp.parse('exists y. (woman(y) & all x.

But let’s have a closer look at Mace4’s model, converted to the format we use for valuations: \nThe general form of this valuation should be familiar to you: it contains some individual constants and predicates, each with an appropriate kind of value. What might be puzzling is the C1. This is a “Skolem constant” that the model builder introduces as a representative of the existential quantifier. That is, when the model builder encountered the exists y part of a4, it knew that there is some individual b in the domain which satisfies the open formula in the body of a4. However, it doesn’t know whether b is also the denotation of an individual constant anywhere else in its input, so it makes up a new name for b on the fly, namely C1. Now, since our premises said nothing about the individual constants adam and eve, the model builder has decided there is no reason to treat them as denoting different entities, and they both get mapped to a. Moreover, we didn’t specify that man and woman denote disjoint sets, so the model builder lets their denotations overlap. This illustrates quite dramatically the implicit knowledge that we bring to bear in interpreting our scenario, but which the model builder knows nothing about. So let's add a new assumption which makes the sets of men and women disjoint. The model builder still produces a countermodel, but this time it is more in accord with our intuitions about the situation: \n>>> a7 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ lp.parse('all x. (man(x) -> -woman(x))')   \n$> > > mathrm { ~ g ~ } =$ lp.parse('love(adam,eve)')   \n>>> mc $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.MaceCommand(g, assumptions $ v { r } _ { mathbf { lambda } } =$ [a4, a5, a6, a7])   \n>>> mc.build_model()   \nTrue   \n>>> print mc.valuation   \n$lbrace because c rbrace : iota _ { c } cdot iota _ { mathsf { iota } }$ , 'adam': 'a',   \n'eve': 'b',   \n'love': set([('a', 'c')]), 'man': set([('a',)]), 'woman': set([('b',), ('c',)])} \nOn reflection, we can see that there is nothing in our premises which says that Eve is the only woman in the domain of discourse, so the countermodel in fact is acceptable. If we wanted to rule it out, we would have to add a further assumption such as exists y. all $textsf { x }$ . $( w o m a n ( x ) to ( x = y ) )$ ) to ensure that there is only one woman in the model. \n10.4  The Semantics of English Sentences \nCompositional Semantics in Feature-Based Grammar \nAt the beginning of the chapter we briefly illustrated a method of building semantic representations on the basis of a syntactic parse, using the grammar framework developed in Chapter 9. This time, rather than constructing an SQL query, we will build a logical form. One of our guiding ideas for designing such grammars is the Principle of Compositionality. (Also known as Frege’s Principle; see [Partee, 1995] for the formulation given.) \nPrinciple of Compositionality: the meaning of a whole is a function of the meanings of the parts and of the way they are syntactically combined. \nWe will assume that the semantically relevant parts of a complex expression are given by a theory of syntactic analysis. Within this chapter, we will take it for granted that expressions are parsed against a context-free grammar. However, this is not entailed by the Principle of Compositionality. \nOur goal now is to integrate the construction of a semantic representation in a manner that can be smoothly with the process of parsing. (29) illustrates a first approximation to the kind of analyses we would like to build. \n(29) S[SEM=<bark(cyril)>] NP[SEM=<(cyril)>] VP[SEM=<bark>] Cyril IV[SEM=<X.bark>] x barks \nIn (29), the SEM value at the root node shows a semantic representation for the whole sentence, while the SEM values at lower nodes show semantic representations for constituents of the sentence. Since the values of SEM have to be treated in a special manner, they are distinguished from other feature values by being enclosed in angle brackets. \nSo far, so good, but how do we write grammar rules that will give us this kind of result? Our approach will be similar to that adopted for the grammar sql0.fcfg at the start of this chapter, in that we will assign semantic representations to lexical nodes, and then compose the semantic representations for each phrase from those of its child nodes. However, in the present case we will use function application rather than string concatenation as the mode of composition. To be more specific, suppose we have NP and VP constituents with appropriate values for their SEM nodes. Then the SEM value of an S is handled by a rule like (30). (Observe that in the case where the value of SEM is a variable, we omit the angle brackets.)",

(Observe that in the case where the value of SEM is a variable, we omit the angle brackets.) \n(30) tells us that given some SEM value ?subj for the subject NP and some SEM value ?vp for the VP, the SEM value of the S parent is constructed by applying ?vp as a function expression to ?np. From this, we can conclude that ?vp has to denote a function which has the denotation of ?np in its domain. (30) is a nice example of building semantics using the principle of compositionality. \nTo complete the grammar is very straightforward; all we require are the rules shown here: \nThe VP rule says that the parent’s semantics is the same as the head child’s semantics. The two lexical rules provide non-logical constants to serve as the semantic values of Cyril and barks respectively. There is an additional piece of notation in the entry for barks which we will explain shortly. \nBefore launching into compositional semantic rules in more detail, we need to add a new tool to our kit, namely the $lambda$ -calculus. This provides us with an invaluable tool for combining expressions of first-order logic as we assemble a meaning representation for an English sentence. \nThe λ-Calculus \nIn Section 1.3, we pointed out that mathematical set notation was a helpful method of specifying properties $P$ of words that we wanted to select from a document. We illustrated this with (31), which we glossed as “the set of all $boldsymbol { w }$ such that $boldsymbol { w }$ is an element of $V$ (the vocabulary) and $boldsymbol { w }$ has property $P ^ { prime prime }$ . \nIt turns out to be extremely useful to add something to first-order logic that will achieve the same effect. We do this with the $lambda$ -operator (pronounced “lambda”). The $lambda$ counterpart to (31) is (32). (Since we are not trying to do set theory here, we just treat $V$ as a unary predicate.) \nλ expressions were originally designed by Alonzo Church to represent computable functions and to provide a foundation for mathematics and logic. The theory in which $lambda$ expressions are studied is known as the λ-calculus. Note that the $lambda$ -calculus is not part of first-order logic—both can be used independently of the other.",

The two lexical rules provide non-logical constants to serve as the semantic values of Cyril and barks respectively. There is an additional piece of notation in the entry for barks which we will explain shortly. \nBefore launching into compositional semantic rules in more detail, we need to add a new tool to our kit, namely the $lambda$ -calculus. This provides us with an invaluable tool for combining expressions of first-order logic as we assemble a meaning representation for an English sentence. \nThe λ-Calculus \nIn Section 1.3, we pointed out that mathematical set notation was a helpful method of specifying properties $P$ of words that we wanted to select from a document. We illustrated this with (31), which we glossed as “the set of all $boldsymbol { w }$ such that $boldsymbol { w }$ is an element of $V$ (the vocabulary) and $boldsymbol { w }$ has property $P ^ { prime prime }$ . \nIt turns out to be extremely useful to add something to first-order logic that will achieve the same effect. We do this with the $lambda$ -operator (pronounced “lambda”). The $lambda$ counterpart to (31) is (32). (Since we are not trying to do set theory here, we just treat $V$ as a unary predicate.) \nλ expressions were originally designed by Alonzo Church to represent computable functions and to provide a foundation for mathematics and logic. The theory in which $lambda$ expressions are studied is known as the λ-calculus. Note that the $lambda$ -calculus is not part of first-order logic—both can be used independently of the other. \n$lambda$ is a binding operator, just as the first-order logic quantifiers are. If we have an open formula, such as (33a), then we can bind the variable $x$ with the $lambda$ operator, as shown in (33b). The corresponding NLTK representation is given in (33c). \nRemember that  is a special character in Python strings. We must either escape it (with another ), or else use “raw strings” (Section 3.4) as shown here: \n>>> lp $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.LogicParser()   \n>>> e $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ lp.parse(r'x.(walk(x) & chew_gum(x))')   \n>>> e   \n<LambdaExpression x.(walk(x) & chew_gum(x))>   \n>>> e.free()   \nset([])   \n>>> print lp.parse(r'x.(walk(x) & chew_gum(y))')   \nx.(walk(x) & chew_gum(y)) \nWe have a special name for the result of binding the variables in an expression: $lambda$ -abstraction. When you first encounter $lambda$ -abstracts, it can be hard to get an intuitive sense of their meaning. A couple of English glosses for (33b) are: “be an $x$ such that $x$ walks and $x$ chews gum” or “have the property of walking and chewing gum.” It has often been suggested that $lambda$ -abstracts are good representations for verb phrases (or subjectless clauses), particularly when these occur as arguments in their own right. This is illustrated in (34a) and its translation, (34b). \n(34) a. To walk and chew gum is hard b. hard(x.(walk(x) & chew_gum(x)) \nSo the general picture is this: given an open formula $boldsymbol { Phi }$ with free variable $x$ , abstracting over $x$ yields a property expression λx. $boldsymbol { Phi }$ —the property of being an $x$ such that $varphi$ . Here’s a more official version of how abstracts are built: \n(35) If α is of type τ, and $x$ is a variable of type $e$ , then $backslash mathsf { x } . mathsf { a }$ is of type $langle e , mathsf { T } rangle$ . \n(34b) illustrated a case where we say something about a property, namely that it is hard. But what we usually do with properties is attribute them to individuals. And in fact, if $varphi$ is an open formula, then the abstract $lambda x . Phi$ can be used as a unary predicate. In (36), (33b) is predicated of the term gerald. \nNow (36) says that Gerald has the property of walking and chewing gum, which has the same meaning as (37). \n(37) (walk(gerald) & chew_gum(gerald)) \nWhat we have done here is remove the $backslash times$ from the beginning of $begin{array}{c} backslash times . ( { boldsymbol { mathsf { w a l k } } } ( { boldsymbol { mathsf { x } } } )  { boldsymbol { mathsf { ell } } } otimes { boldsymbol { mathsf { ell } } } end{array}$ chew_gum(x)) and replaced all occurrences of $mathsf { x }$ in $( mathsf { w a l k } ( mathsf { x } )  &  mathsf { c h e w _ g u m } ( mathsf { x } ) )$ by gerald. We’ll use ${ tt G } [ beta / x ]$ as notation for the operation of replacing all free occurrences of $x$ in $mathtt { q }$ by the expression $beta$ . So \nrepresents the same expression as (37). The “reduction” of (36) to (37) is an extremely useful operation in simplifying semantic representations, and we shall use it a lot in the rest of this chapter. The operation is often called $beta$ -reduction. In order for it to be semantically justified, we want it to hold that λx. ${ tt G } ( beta )$ has the same semantic value as ${ tt G } [ beta / x ]$ . This is indeed true, subject to a slight complication that we will come to shortly. In order to carry out $beta$ -reduction of expressions in NLTK, we can call the simplify() method $bullet$ . \nAlthough we have so far only considered cases where the body of the $lambda$ -abstract is an open formula, i.e., of type $t$ , this is not a necessary restriction; the body can be any wellformed expression. Here’s an example with two λs: \nJust as (33b) plays the role of a unary predicate, (38) works like a binary predicate: it can be applied directly to two arguments $bullet$ . The LogicParser allows nested λs such as $backslash mathsf { x } . backslash mathsf { y }$ . to be written in the abbreviated form $backslash times  y . bullet$ . \n>>> print lp.parse(r'x.y.(dog(x) & own(y, x))(cyril)').simplify()   \ny.(dog(cyril) & own(y,cyril))   \n>>> $mathrm { p r i n t ~ 1 p . p a r s e ( r ^ { cdot } ~ | x ~ hat { y } . ~ ( d o g ( x ) ~ & ~ o w n ( y , ~ x ) ) ( c y r i l , ~ a n g u s ) ~ ^ { cdot } ) . s i m p l i f y ( textbf { em O } ) . }$   \n(dog(cyril) & own(angus,cyril)) \nAll our $lambda$ -abstracts so far have involved the familiar first-order variables: x, y, and so on —variables of type $e$ . But suppose we want to treat one abstract, say, $mathsf { backslash x . w a l k ( x ) }$ , as the argument of another $lambda$ -abstract? We might try this: \nBut since the variable $mathsf { y }$ is stipulated to be of type $e$ , y.y(angus) only applies to arguments of type $e$ while $mathsf { backslash x . w a l k ( x ) }$ is of type $langle e , t rangle !$ Instead, we need to allow abstraction over variables of higher type. Let’s use P and Q as variables of type $langle e , t rangle$ , and then we can have an abstract such as P.P(angus). Since P is of type $langle e , t rangle$ , the whole abstract is of type $langle langle e , t rangle , t rangle$ . Then P.P(angus) $( backslash mathsf { x } . mathsf { w a l k } ( mathsf { x } ) )$ is legal, and can be simplified via $beta .$ - reduction to $mathsf { backslash x . w a l k ( x ) }$ (angus) and then again to walk(angus). \nWhen carrying out $beta$ -reduction, some care has to be taken with variables. Consider, for example, the $lambda$ -terms (39a) and (39b), which differ only in the identity of a free variable. \n(39) $begin{array} { r } { mathrm { a . ~ } backslash forall . mathsf { s e e } ( mathsf { y } , mathrm { ~ mathsf { x } ) } }  { mathrm { b . ~ } backslash forall . mathsf { s e e } ( mathsf { y } , mathrm { ~ mathsf { z } ) } } end{array}$ \nSuppose now that we apply the $lambda$ -term P.exists $mathsf { x } . mathsf { P } ( mathsf { x } )$ to each of these terms: \n(40) $begin{array} { r l } & { mathrm { a . ~ } backslash mathsf { P . e x i s t s ~ } times . mathsf { P } ( mathsf { x } ) ( backslash mathsf { y . s e e } ( mathsf { y } ,  mathsf { x } ) ) }  & { mathrm { b . ~ } backslash mathsf { P . e x i s t s ~ } times . mathsf { P } ( mathsf { x } ) ( backslash mathsf { y . s e e } ( mathsf { y } ,  mathsf { z } ) ) } end{array}$ \nWe pointed out earlier that the results of the application should be semantically equivalent. But if we let the free variable $mathsf { x }$ in (39a) fall inside the scope of the existential quantifier in (40a), then after reduction, the results will be different: \n(41) $begin{array} { c } { { mathrm { a . ~ e x i s t s ~ } times . { sf s e e } ( mathrm { x } , mathrm {  ~ times } ) } }  { { mathrm { b . ~ e x i s t s ~ } times . { sf s e e } ( mathrm { x } , mathrm {  ~ times } ) } } end{array}$ \n(41a) means there is some x that sees him/herself, whereas (41b) means that there is some x that sees an unspecified individual z. What has gone wrong here? Clearly, we want to forbid the kind of variable “capture” shown in (41a). \nIn order to deal with this problem, let’s step back a moment. Does it matter what particular name we use for the variable bound by the existential quantifier in the function expression of (40a)? The answer is no. In fact, given any variable-binding expression (involving $forall$ , ∃, or $lambda$ ), the name chosen for the bound variable is completely arbitrary. For example, exists $mathsf { x } . mathsf { P } ( mathsf { x } )$ and exists y.P(y) are equivalent; they are called α-equivalents, or alphabetic variants. The process of relabeling bound variables is known as ${ pmb { alpha } } .$ -conversion. When we test for equality of VariableBinderExpressions in the logic module (i.e., using $scriptstyle = =$ ), we are in fact testing for $mathtt { q }$ -equivalence: \n>>> e1 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ lp.parse('exists x.P(x)')   \n>>> print e1   \nexists $mathsf { x } . mathsf { P } ( mathsf { x } )$   \n>>> e2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ e1.alpha_convert(nltk.Variable('z'))   \n$gg >$ print e2   \nexists $z . { mathsf { P } } ( z )$   \n>>> e1 $scriptstyle = =$ e2   \nTrue \nWhen $beta$ -reduction is carried out on an application ${ sf f } ( { sf a } )$ , we check whether there are free variables in a that also occur as bound variables in any subterms of f. Suppose, as in the example just discussed, that x is free in a, and that $mathsf { f }$ contains the subterm exists $mathsf { x } . mathsf { P } ( mathsf { x } )$ . In this case, we produce an alphabetic variant of exists $mathsf { x } . mathsf { P } ( mathsf { x } )$ , say, exists z1.P(z1), and then carry on with the reduction. This relabeling is carried out automatically by the $beta$ -reduction code in logic, and the results can be seen in the following example: \n>>> e3 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ lp.parse('P.exists x.P(x)(y.see(y, x))')   \n$gg >$ print e3   \n(P.exists x.P(x))(y.see(y,x))   \n>>> print e3.simplify()   \nexists z1.see(z1,x) \nAs you work through examples like these in the following sections, you may find that the logical expressions which are returned have different variable names; for example, you might see z14 in place of z1 in the preceding formula. This change in labeling is innocuous—in fact, it is just an illustration of alphabetic variants. \nAfter this excursus, let’s return to the task of building logical forms for English sentences. \nQuantified NPs \nAt the start of this section, we briefly described how to build a semantic representation for Cyril barks. You would be forgiven for thinking this was all too easy—surely there is a bit more to building compositional semantics. What about quantifiers, for instance? Right, this is a crucial issue. For example, we want (42a) to be given the logical form in (42b). How can this be accomplished? \n(42) a. A dog barks. b. exists x.(dog(x) & bark(x)) \nLet’s make the assumption that our only operation for building complex semantic representations is function application. Then our problem is this: how do we give a semantic representation to the quantified NPs a dog so that it can be combined with bark to give the result in (42b)? As a first step, let’s make the subject’s SEM value act as the function expression rather than the argument. (This is sometimes called typeraising.) Now we are looking for a way of instantiating ?np so that $[ S E M = < ? n p ( backslash times . mathsf { b a r k } ( mathsf { x } ) ) > ]$ is equivalent to [SEM=<exists x. $mathbf { nabla } cdot ( mathsf { d o g } ( mathsf { x } ) & mathsf { nabla } mathsf { b a r k } ( mathsf { x } ) ) { flat } ]$ . Doesn’t this look a bit reminiscent of carrying out $beta$ -reduction in the $lambda$ -calculus? In other words, we want a $lambda$ -term $M$ to replace ?np so that applying $M$ to $backslash mathsf { x } . mathsf { b a r k } ( mathsf { x } )$ yields (42b). To do this, we replace the occurrence of $backslash mathsf { x } . mathsf { b a r k } ( mathsf { x } )$ in (42b) by a predicate variable P, and bind the variable with $lambda$ , as shown in (43). \nWe have used a different style of variable in (43)—that is, $because mathsf { P } ^ { prime }$ rather than $because x ^ { prime }$ or $cdot _ { y ^ { prime } - }$ to signal that we are abstracting over a different kind of object—not an individual, but a function expression of type $langle e , t rangle$ . So the type of (43) as a whole is $langle langle e , t rangle , t rangle$ . We will take this to be the type of NPs in general. To illustrate further, a universally quantified NP will look like (44).",

(48) is equivalent via $beta$ - reduction to exists $mathsf { x } .

We can ensure this by abstracting over both the X variable in (49) and also the subject variable y. So the full solution is reached by giving chases the semantic representation shown in (50). \n(50) \nIf (50) is applied to (43), the result after $beta$ -reduction is equivalent to (47), which is what we wanted all along: \nIn order to build a semantic representation for a sentence, we also need to combine in the semantics of the subject NP. If the latter is a quantified expression, such as every girl, everything proceeds in the same way as we showed for a dog barks earlier on; the subject is translated as a function expression which is applied to the semantic representation of the VP. However, we now seem to have created another problem for ourselves with proper names. So far, these have been treated semantically as individual constants, and these cannot be applied as functions to expressions like (47). Consequently, we need to come up with a different semantic representation for them. What we do in this case is reinterpret proper names so that they too are function expressions, like quantified NPs. Here is the required $lambda$ -expression for Angus: \n(51) P.P(angus) \n(51) denotes the characteristic function corresponding to the set of all properties which are true of Angus. Converting from an individual constant angus to P.P(angus) is another example of type-raising, briefly mentioned earlier, and allows us to replace a Boolean-valued application such as x.walk(x)(angus) with an equivalent function application P.P(angus)(x.walk(x)). By $beta$ -reduction, both expressions reduce to walk(angus). \nThe grammar simple-sem.fcfg contains a small set of rules for parsing and translating simple examples of the kind that we have been looking at. Here’s a slightly more complicated example: \n>>> from nltk import load_parser   \n>>> parser $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ load_parser('grammars/book_grammars/simple-sem.fcfg', trace=0)   \n>>> sentence $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Angus gives a bone to every dog'   \n>>> tokens $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sentence.split()   \n>>> trees $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ parser.nbest_parse(tokens)   \n>>> for tree in trees: print tree.node['SEM']   \nall z2.(dog(z2) -> exists z1.(bone(z1) & give(angus,z1,z2))) \n\nNLTK provides some utilities to make it easier to derive and inspect semantic interpretations. The function batch_interpret() is intended for batch interpretation of a list of input sentences. It builds a dictionary d where for each sentence sent in the input, d[sent] is a list of pairs (synrep, semrep) consisting of trees and semantic representations for sent. The value is a list since sent may be syntactically ambiguous; in the following example, however, there is only one parse tree per sentence in the list. \nWe have seen now how to convert English sentences into logical forms, and earlier we saw how logical forms could be checked as true or false in a model. Putting these two mappings together, we can check the truth value of English sentences in a given model. Let’s take model m as defined earlier. The utility batch_evaluate() resembles batch_interpret(), except that we need to pass a model and a variable assignment as parameters. The output is a triple (synrep, semrep, value), where synrep, semrep are as before, and value is a truth value. For simplicity, the following example only processes a single sentence. \n>>> 11 bertie $Rightarrow ~ { mathsf { b } }$ olive $Rightarrow$ o cyril $Rightarrow$ c boy $Rightarrow { b }$ $therefore mathrm { g i r l }  Rightarrow  { 0 }$ dog => {c} walk $Rightarrow$ {o, c} see $Rightarrow$ {(b, o), (c, b), (o, c)} \"=   \n>>> val $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.parse_valuation(v)   \n>>> g $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ nltk.Assignment(val.domain)   \n>>> m $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Model(val.domain, val)   \n>>> sent $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'Cyril sees every boy'   \n$gg >$ grammar_file $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'grammars/book_grammars/simple-sem.fcfg'   \n$gg >$ results $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.batch_evaluate([sent], grammar_file, m, g)[0]   \n>>> for (syntree, semrel, value) in results: print semrep \nprint value exists z3.(ankle(z3) & bite(cyril,z3)) True \nQuantifier Ambiguity Revisited \nOne important limitation of the methods described earlier is that they do not deal with scope ambiguity. Our translation method is syntax-driven, in the sense that the semantic representation is closely coupled with the syntactic analysis, and the scope of the quantifiers in the semantics therefore reflects the relative scope of the corresponding NPs in the syntactic parse tree. Consequently, a sentence like (26), repeated here, will always be translated as (53a), not (53b). \n(52) Every girl chases a dog. \nThere are numerous approaches to dealing with scope ambiguity, and we will look very briefly at one of the simplest. To start with, let’s briefly consider the structure of scoped formulas. Figure 10-3 depicts the way in which the two readings of (52) differ. \nLet’s consider the lefthand structure first. At the top, we have the quantifier corresponding to every girl. The $varphi$ can be thought of as a placeholder for whatever is inside the scope of the quantifier. Moving downward, we see that we can plug in the quantifier corresponding to a dog as an instantiation of $varphi$ . This gives a new placeholder $psi$ , representing the scope of a dog, and into this we can plug the “core” of the semantics, namely the open sentence corresponding to $x$ chases y. The structure on the righthand side is identical, except we have swapped round the order of the two quantifiers. \nIn the method known as Cooper storage, a semantic representation is no longer an expression of first-order logic, but instead a pair consisting of a “core” semantic representation plus a list of binding operators. For the moment, think of a binding operator as being identical to the semantic representation of a quantified NP such as (44) or (45). Following along the lines indicated in Figure 10-3, let’s assume that we have constructed a Cooper-storage-style semantic representation of sentence (52), and let’s take our core to be the open formula $mathsf { c h a s e } ( mathsf { x } , mathsf { y } )$ .

Our translation method is syntax-driven, in the sense that the semantic representation is closely coupled with the syntactic analysis, and the scope of the quantifiers in the semantics therefore reflects the relative scope of the corresponding NPs in the syntactic parse tree. Consequently, a sentence like (26), repeated here, will always be translated as (53a), not (53b). \n(52) Every girl chases a dog. \nThere are numerous approaches to dealing with scope ambiguity, and we will look very briefly at one of the simplest. To start with, let’s briefly consider the structure of scoped formulas. Figure 10-3 depicts the way in which the two readings of (52) differ. \nLet’s consider the lefthand structure first. At the top, we have the quantifier corresponding to every girl. The $varphi$ can be thought of as a placeholder for whatever is inside the scope of the quantifier. Moving downward, we see that we can plug in the quantifier corresponding to a dog as an instantiation of $varphi$ . This gives a new placeholder $psi$ , representing the scope of a dog, and into this we can plug the “core” of the semantics, namely the open sentence corresponding to $x$ chases y. The structure on the righthand side is identical, except we have swapped round the order of the two quantifiers. \nIn the method known as Cooper storage, a semantic representation is no longer an expression of first-order logic, but instead a pair consisting of a “core” semantic representation plus a list of binding operators. For the moment, think of a binding operator as being identical to the semantic representation of a quantified NP such as (44) or (45). Following along the lines indicated in Figure 10-3, let’s assume that we have constructed a Cooper-storage-style semantic representation of sentence (52), and let’s take our core to be the open formula $mathsf { c h a s e } ( mathsf { x } , mathsf { y } )$ . Given a list of binding operators corresponding to the two NPs in (52), we pick a binding operator off the list, and combine it with the core. \n\nThen we take the result, and apply the next binding operator from the list to it. \nOnce the list is empty, we have a conventional logical form for the sentence. Combining binding operators with the core in this way is called S-Retrieval. If we are careful to allow every possible order of binding operators (for example, by taking all permutations of the list; see Section 4.5), then we will be able to generate every possible scope ordering of quantifiers. \nThe next question to address is how we build up a core $^ +$ store representation compositionally. As before, each phrasal and lexical rule in the grammar will have a SEM feature, but now there will be embedded features CORE and STORE. To illustrate the machinery, let’s consider a simpler example, namely Cyril smiles. Here’s a lexical rule for the verb smiles (taken from the grammar storage.fcfg), which looks pretty innocuous: \nIV[SEM=[CORE=<x.smile(x)>, STORE $vdots =$ (/)]] -> 'smiles' \nThe rule for the proper name Cyril is more complex. \nThe bo predicate has two subparts: the standard (type-raised) representation of a proper name, and the expression ${ mathfrak { Q } } times$ , which is called the address of the binding operator. (We’ll explain the need for the address variable shortly.) ${ mathfrak { Q } } times$ is a metavariable, that is, a variable that ranges over individual variables of the logic and, as you will see, also provides the value of core. The rule for VP just percolates up the semantics of the IV, and the interesting work is done by the S rule. \nThe core value at the S node is the result of applying the VP’s core value, namely x.smile(x), to the subject NP’s value. The latter will not be ${ mathfrak { Q } } times$ , but rather an instantiation of ${ boldsymbol {  @ } } times { boldsymbol {  ? } }$ , say, z3. After $beta$ -reduction, $< ? mathsf { v p } ( ref { a i b j } ) >$ will be unified with <smile(z3)>. Now, when $@ times$ is instantiated as part of the parsing process, it will be instantiated uniformly. In particular, the occurrence of ${ mathfrak { Q } } times$ in the subject NP’s STORE will also be mapped to z3, yielding the element bo(P.P(cyril),z3). These steps can be seen in the following parse tree. \nLet’s return to our more complex example, (52), and see what the storage style SEM value is, after parsing with grammar storage.fcfg. \nIt should be clearer now why the address variables are an important part of the binding operator. Recall that during S-retrieval, we will be taking binding operators off the STORE list and applying them successively to the CORE. Suppose we start with bo(P.all $mathbf { boldsymbol { x } } . ( operatorname { g i r 1 } ( mathbf { boldsymbol { x } } )  cdot >  mathsf { P } ( mathbf { boldsymbol { x } } ) ) , z mathbf { 1 } )$ ), which we want to combine with chase(z1,z2). The quantifier part of the binding operator is $mathsf { backslash P . a l l  x . ( g i r l ( x ) to P ( x ) ) }$ , and to combine this with chase(z1,z2), the latter needs to first be turned into a $lambda$ -abstract. How do we know which variable to abstract over? This is what the address z1 tells us, i.e., that every girl has the role of chaser rather than chasee. \nThe module nltk.sem.cooper_storage deals with the task of turning storage-style semantic representations into standard logical forms. First, we construct a CooperStore instance, and inspect its STORE and CORE. \n>>> from nltk.sem import cooper_storage as cs   \n>>> sentence $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ 'every girl chases a dog'   \n>>> trees $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ cs.parse_with_bindops(sentence, grammar $mathbf { bar { rho } } = mathbf { rho }$ 'grammars/book_grammars/storage.fcfg')   \n>>> semrep $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ trees[0].node['sem']   \n>>> cs_semrep $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ cs.CooperStore(semrep)   \n>>> print cs_semrep.core   \nchase(z1,z2)   \n>>> for bo in cs_semrep.store: print bo   \n${ mathsf { b o } } { mathsf { ( } } backslash { mathsf { P } } { mathrm { . } } a { mathrm { 1 1 ~ } } { mathsf { x . } } { mathrm { ( g i r l ( x ) ~ } } { mathsf { - } } { mathsf {  P ( x ) } } { mathsf { ) } } , { mathsf { z 1 } } { mathsf { ) } }$   \nbo(P.exists x.(dog(x) & P(x)),z2) \nFinally, we call s_retrieve() and check the readings. \n>>> cs_semrep.s_retrieve(trace=True)   \nPermutation 1 (P.all x.(girl(x) -> P(x)))(z1.chase(z1,z2)) (P.exists x.(dog(x) & P(x)))(z2.all x.(girl(x) -> chase(x,z2)))   \nPermutation 2 (P.exists x.(dog(x) & P(x)))(z2.chase(z1,z2)) $( backslash { mathsf { P } } . { mathrm { a l 1 ~ } } times . ( mathrm { g i r 1 } ( mathsf { x } )  cdot  mathsf { P } ( mathsf { x } ) ) ;$ (z1.exists x.(dog(x) & chase(z1,x)))   \n>>> for reading in cs_semrep.readings: print reading   \nexists x.(dog(x) & all z3.(girl(z3) -> chase(z3,x)))   \nall $mathsf { x } . ( mathsf { g i r l } ( mathsf { x } ) to mathsf { Gamma }$ exists z4.(dog(z4) & chase(x,z4))) \n10.5  Discourse Semantics \nA discourse is a sequence of sentences. Very often, the interpretation of a sentence in a discourse depends on what preceded it. A clear example of this comes from anaphoric pronouns, such as he, she, and it. Given a discourse such as Angus used to have a dog. But he recently disappeared., you will probably interpret he as referring to Angus’s dog. However, in Angus used to have a dog. He took him for walks in New Town., you are more likely to interpret he as referring to Angus himself. \nDiscourse Representation Theory \nThe standard approach to quantification in first-order logic is limited to single sentences. Yet there seem to be examples where the scope of a quantifier can extend over two or more sentences. We saw one earlier, and here’s a second example, together with a translation. \n(54) a. Angus owns a dog. It bit Irene. b. $exists x . ( d o g ( x )  & o w n ( A n g u s , x )  & b i t e ( x , I r e n e ) )$ \nThat is, the NP a dog acts like a quantifier which binds the it in the second sentence. Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) was developed with the specific goal of providing a means for handling this and other semantic phenomena which seem to be characteristic of discourse. A discourse representation structure (DRS) presents the meaning of discourse in terms of a list of discourse referents and a list of conditions. The discourse referents are the things under discussion in the discourse, and they correspond to the individual variables of first-order logic. The DRS conditions apply to those discourse referents, and correspond to atomic open formulas of first-order logic. Figure 10-4 illustrates how a DRS for the first sentence in (54a) is augmented to become a DRS for both sentences. \nWhen the second sentence of (54a) is processed, it is interpreted in the context of what is already present in the lefthand side of Figure 10-4. The pronoun it triggers the addition of a new discourse referent, say, $u$ , and we need to find an anaphoric antecedent for it—that is, we want to work out what it refers to. In DRT, the task of finding the antecedent for an anaphoric pronoun involves linking it to a discourse referent already within the current DRS, and $y$ is the obvious choice. (We will say more about anaphora resolution shortly.) This processing step gives rise to a new condition $u = y$ . The remaining content contributed by the second sentence is also merged with the content of the first, and this is shown on the righthand side of Figure 10-4. \nFigure 10-4 illustrates how a DRS can represent more than just a single sentence. In this case, it is a two-sentence discourse, but in principle a single DRS could correspond to the interpretation of a whole text. We can inquire into the truth conditions of the righthand DRS in Figure 10-4. Informally, it is true in some situation $s$ if there are entities a, c, and i in s corresponding to the discourse referents in the DRS such that all the conditions are true in $s$ ; that is, a is named Angus, c is a dog, a owns c, i is named Irene, and c bit i.",

Here’s an example, where the DRS is a pair consisting of a list of discourse referents and a list of DRS conditions: \nThe easiest way to build a DRS object in NLTK is by parsing a string representation $bullet$ . \nWe can use the draw() method $bullet$ to visualize the result, as shown in Figure 10-5. \n>>> drs1.draw() 1 \nWhen we discussed the truth conditions of the DRSs in Figure 10-4, we assumed that the topmost discourse referents were interpreted as existential quantifiers, while the conditions were interpreted as though they are conjoined. In fact, every DRS can be translated into a formula of first-order logic, and the fol() method implements this translation. \n\n>>> print drs1.fol() exists x y.((angus(x) & dog(y)) & own(x,y)) \nIn addition to the functionality available for first-order logic expressions, DRT Expressions have a DRS-concatenation operator, represented as the $^ +$ symbol. The concatenation of two DRSs is a single DRS containing the merged discourse referents and the conditions from both arguments. DRS-concatenation automatically α-converts bound variables to avoid name-clashes. \nWhile all the conditions seen so far have been atomic, it is possible to embed one DRS within another, and this is how universal quantification is handled. In drs3, there are no top-level discourse referents, and the sole condition is made up of two sub-DRSs, connected by an implication. Again, we can use fol() to get a handle on the truth conditions. \nWe pointed out earlier that DRT is designed to allow anaphoric pronouns to be interpreted by linking to existing discourse referents. DRT sets constraints on which discourse referents are “accessible” as possible antecedents, but is not intended to explain how a particular antecedent is chosen from the set of candidates. The module nltk.sem.drt_resolve_anaphora adopts a similarly conservative strategy: if the DRS contains a condition of the form $mathsf { P R O } ( mathsf { x } )$ , the method resolve_anaphora() replaces this with a condition of the form $times  =  [ ldots ]$ , where [...] is a list of possible antecedents. \n>>> drs4 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ dp.parse('([x, y], [angus $( mathsf { x } )$ , dog(y), own(x, y)])') >>> drs5 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ dp.parse('([u, z], [PRO(u), irene(z), bite(u, z)])') $begin{array} { r l } & { mathrm { ~ > > ~ d r s 6 ~ = ~ d r s ' 4 ~ + ~ d r s 5 ~ } }  & { mathrm { ~ > > ~ p r i n t ~  { ~ d r s 6 . 5 1 eta } = ~ } }  & { mathrm { ~ ( [ x , y , u , z ] ~ , ~ [ a n g u s ( x ) , ~ d o g ( y ) , ~ o ~ w n ( x , y ) , ~ mathsf { P R 0 } ( u ) , ~ i r e n e ( z ) , ~ b i t e ( u , z ) ] ) ~ } }  & { mathrm { ~ > ~ p r i n t ~  { ~ d r s 6 . 5 operatorname* { i n p } } { 2 } i dag ~ } f mathrm { ~ ( ~ ) } mathrm { } mathrm { . ~ r e s s 0 . l v e } _ { -  { operatorname* { a n d } } {  { operatorname { b } }  { operatorname { e a } } } } ( mathrm { a } mathrm { n } mathrm { n } mathrm { e } { a } ( ) ) }  & { mathrm { ~ ( [ x , y , u , z ] , ~ [ a n g u s ( x ) , ~ d o g ( y ) , ~ o u n ( x , y ) , ~ ( u = [ x , y , z ] ) , ~ i r e n e ( z ) , ~ b i t e ( u , z ) ] ) ~ } } end{array}$ \nSince the algorithm for anaphora resolution has been separated into its own module, this facilitates swapping in alternative procedures that try to make more intelligent guesses about the correct antecedent. \nOur treatment of DRSs is fully compatible with the existing machinery for handling λ- abstraction, and consequently it is straightforward to build compositional semantic representations that are based on DRT rather than first-order logic. This technique is illustrated in the following rule for indefinites (which is part of the grammar drt.fcfg). For ease of comparison, we have added the parallel rule for indefinites from simplesem.fcfg. \n\nTo get a better idea of how the DRT rule works, look at this subtree for the NP a dog: \nThe $lambda$ -abstract for the indefinite is applied as a function expression to x.([], $left[ { sf d o g ( x ) } right] )$ ) which leads to $backslash 0 . ( ( [ x ] , [ ] )  +  ( [  ] , [ d o g ( x ) ] )  +  0 ( x ) )$ ; after simplification, we get Q.(([x], $[ deg ( mathsf { x } ) ] ) + mathsf { 0 } ( mathsf { x } ) )$ as the representation for the NP as a whole. \nIn order to parse with grammar drt.fcfg, we specify in the call to load_earley() that SEM values in feature structures are to be parsed using DrtParser in place of the default LogicParser. \n>>> from nltk import load_parser   \n>>> parser $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ load_parser('grammars/book_grammars/drt.fcfg', logic_parser=nltk.DrtParser())   \n>>> trees $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ parser.nbest_parse('Angus owns a dog'.split())   \n>>> print trees[0].node['sem'].simplify()   \n([x,z2],[Angus(x), dog(z2), own(x,z2)]) \nDiscourse Processing \nWhen we interpret a sentence, we use a rich context for interpretation, determined in part by the preceding context and in part by our background assumptions. DRT provides a theory of how the meaning of a sentence is integrated into a representation of the prior discourse, but two things have been glaringly absent from the processing approach just discussed. First, there has been no attempt to incorporate any kind of inference; and second, we have only processed individual sentences. These omissions are redressed by the module nltk.inference.discourse. \nWhereas a discourse is a sequence $s _ { 1 } , ldots s _ { n }$ of sentences, a discourse thread is a sequence $s _ { 1 } – r _ { i } , ldots s _ { n ^ { - } } r _ { j }$ of readings, one for each sentence in the discourse. The module processes sentences incrementally, keeping track of all possible threads when there is ambiguity. For simplicity, the following example ignores scope ambiguity: \n>>> dt $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.DiscourseTester(['A student dances', 'Every student is a person'])   \n>>> dt.readings()   \ns0 readings: s0-r0: exists x.(student(x) & dance(x))   \ns1 readings: s1-r0: all x.(student(x) -> person(x)) \nWhen a new sentence is added to the current discourse, setting the parameter consistchk $ c =$ True causes consistency to be checked by invoking the model checker for each thread, i.e., each sequence of admissible readings. In this case, the user has the option of retracting the sentence in question.",

(Equally, there are a variety of phenomena in natural language semantics which are believed to require more powerful logical mechanisms.)   \n• As well as translating natural language sentences into first-order logic, we can state the truth conditions of these sentences by examining models of first-order formulas.   \n• In order to build meaning representations compositionally, we supplement firstorder logic with the $lambda$ -calculus.   \n• $beta$ -reduction in the λ-calculus corresponds semantically to application of a function to an argument. Syntactically, it involves replacing a variable bound by $lambda$ in the function expression with the expression that provides the argument in the function application.   \n• A key part of constructing a model lies in building a valuation which assigns interpretations to non-logical constants. These are interpreted as either $n$ -ary predicates or as individual constants.   \n• An open expression is an expression containing one or more free variables. Open expressions receive an interpretation only when their free variables receive values from a variable assignment.   \n• Quantifiers are interpreted by constructing, for a formula $varphi [ { boldsymbol { x } } ]$ open in variable $x$ , the set of individuals which make $varphi [ { boldsymbol { x } } ]$ true when an assignment $g$ assigns them as the value of $x$ .

        "content": "When we examine threads d0 and ${ mathsf { d } } 1$ , we see that reading ${ mathsf { s o } } - { mathsf { r o } }$ , where every dog outscopes a boy, is deemed inadmissible because the pronoun in the second sentence cannot be resolved. By contrast, in thread d1 the pronoun (relettered to z10) has been bound via the equation $( z 1 0 ~ = ~ z 6 )$ ). \nInadmissible readings can be filtered out by passing the parameter filter $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ True. \n>>> dt.readings(show_thread_readings $ L _ {  L } =$ True, filter $mathbf { bar { rho } } = mathbf { rho }$ True) d1: ['s0-r1', 's1-r0'] : ([z12,z15],[boy(z12), (([x],[dog(x)]) -> ([],[chases(x,z12)])), $z 1 7  =  z 1 5 ,$ ), runs(z15)]) \nAlthough this little discourse is extremely limited, it should give you a feel for the kind of semantic processing issues that arise when we go beyond single sentences, and also a feel for the techniques that can be deployed to address them. \n10.6  Summary \n• First-order logic is a suitable language for representing natural language meaning in a computational setting since it is flexible enough to represent many useful aspects of natural meaning, and there are efficient theorem provers for reasoning with first-order logic. (Equally, there are a variety of phenomena in natural language semantics which are believed to require more powerful logical mechanisms.)   \n• As well as translating natural language sentences into first-order logic, we can state the truth conditions of these sentences by examining models of first-order formulas.   \n• In order to build meaning representations compositionally, we supplement firstorder logic with the $lambda$ -calculus.   \n• $beta$ -reduction in the λ-calculus corresponds semantically to application of a function to an argument. Syntactically, it involves replacing a variable bound by $lambda$ in the function expression with the expression that provides the argument in the function application.   \n• A key part of constructing a model lies in building a valuation which assigns interpretations to non-logical constants. These are interpreted as either $n$ -ary predicates or as individual constants.   \n• An open expression is an expression containing one or more free variables. Open expressions receive an interpretation only when their free variables receive values from a variable assignment.   \n• Quantifiers are interpreted by constructing, for a formula $varphi [ { boldsymbol { x } } ]$ open in variable $x$ , the set of individuals which make $varphi [ { boldsymbol { x } } ]$ true when an assignment $g$ assigns them as the value of $x$ . The quantifier then places constraints on that set.   \n• A closed expression is one that has no free variables; that is, the variables are all bound. A closed sentence is true or false with respect to all variable assignments.   \n• If two formulas differ only in the label of the variable bound by binding operator (i.e., $lambda$ or a quantifier) , they are said to be ${ mathfrak { a } }$ -equivalents. The result of relabeling a bound variable in a formula is called α-conversion.   \n• Given a formula with two nested quantifiers $Q _ { 1 }$ and $Q _ { 2 }$ , the outermost quantifier $Q _ { 1 }$ is said to have wide scope (or scope over $scriptstyle { Q _ { 2 } } ,$ ). English sentences are frequently ambiguous with respect to the scope of the quantifiers they contain. English sentences can be associated with a semantic representation by treating SEM as a feature in a feature-based grammar. The SEM value of a complex expressions, typically involves functional application of the SEM values of the component expressions. \n\n10.7  Further Reading \nConsult http://www.nltk.org/ for further materials on this chapter and on how to install the Prover9 theorem prover and Mace4 model builder.

In order for ApplicationExpression(e1, e2) to be $beta$ -convertible to exists y.love(pat, y), e1 must be a λ-abstract which can take pat as an argument. Your task is to construct such an abstract, bind it to e1, and satisfy yourself that these statements are all satisfied (up to alphabetic variance). In addition, provide an informal English translation of e3.simplify(). \nNow carry on doing this same task for the further cases of e3.simplify() shown here: \n>>> print e3.simplify() exists y.(love(pat,y) | love(y,pat)) >>> print e3.simplify() exists y.(love(pat,y) | love(y,pat)) >>> print e3.simplify() walk(fido) \n6. $scriptscriptstyle mathrm { ~ o ~ }$ As in the preceding exercise, find a $lambda$ -abstract e1 that yields results equivalent to those shown here: \n>>> e2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ lp.parse('chase') >>> e3 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.ApplicationExpression(e1, e2) \n>>> print e3.simplify()   \nx.all y.(dog(y) -> chase(x,pat))   \n>>> e2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ lp.parse('chase')   \n>>> e3 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)   \n>>> print e3.simplify()   \nx.exists y.(dog(y) & chase(pat,x))   \n>>> e2 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ lp.parse('give')   \n>>> $mathtt { e 3 }  =$ nltk.ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)   \n$gg >$ print e3.simplify()   \nx0 x1.exists y.(present(y) & give(x1,y,x0)) \n7. $bigcirc$ As in the preceding exercise, find a $lambda$ -abstract e1 that yields results equivalent to those shown here: \n>>> e2 = lp.parse('bark')   \n>>> e3 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)   \n>>> print e3.simplify()   \nexists y. $mathbf { partial } cdot ( mathsf { d o g } ( mathbf { x } )  &  mathsf { b a r k } ( mathbf { x } ) )$   \n>>> e2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ lp.parse('bark')   \n>>> e3 $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)   \n>>> print e3.simplify()   \nbark(fido)   \n>>> e2 = lp.parse('P. all x. $( mathsf { d o g } ( mathsf { x } ) to mathsf { P } ( mathsf { x } ) ) ^ { bullet } )$ ) $> > > mathtt { e 3 }  =$ nltk.ApplicationExpression(e1, e2)   \n$gg >$ print e3.simplify()   \nall $mathsf { x } . ( mathsf { d o g } ( mathsf { x } ) to mathsf { b a r k } ( mathsf { x } ) )$   \n8. $mathbf { 0 }$ Develop a method for translating English sentences into formulas with binary generalized quantifiers. In such an approach, given a generalized quantifier Q, a quantified formula is of the form Q(A, B), where both A and B are expressions of type $langle e , t rangle$ . Then, for example, all(A, B) is true iff A denotes a subset of what B denotes.   \n9. $mathbf { 0 }$ Extend the approach in the preceding exercise so that the truth conditions for quantifiers such as most and exactly three can be computed in a model.   \n10. $mathbf { 0 }$ Modify the sem.evaluate code so that it will give a helpful error message if an expression is not in the domain of a model’s valuation function.   \n11. $bullet$ Select three or four contiguous sentences from a book for children. A possible source of examples are the collections of stories in nltk.corpus.gutenberg: bryantstories.txt, burgess-busterbrown.txt, and edgeworth-parents.txt. Develop a grammar that will allow your sentences to be translated into first-order logic, and build a model that will allow those translations to be checked for truth or falsity.   \n12. $bullet$ Carry out the preceding exercise, but use DRT as the meaning representation.   \n13. $bullet$ Taking (Warren & Pereira, 1982) as a starting point, develop a technique for converting a natural language query into a form that can be evaluated more efficiently in a model. For example, given a query of the form $( { mathsf { P } } ( times )  &  { mathsf { 0 } } ( times ) )$ , convert it to $( 0 ( times ) texttt { & P } ( times ) )$ if the extension of Q is smaller than the extension of P. \n\nManaging Linguistic Data \nStructured collections of annotated linguistic data are essential in most areas of NLP; however, we still face many obstacles in using them. The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions: \n1. How do we design a new language resource and ensure that its coverage, balance, and documentation support a wide range of uses?   \n2. When existing data is in the wrong format for some analysis tool, how can we convert it to a suitable format?   \n3. What is a good way to document the existence of a resource we have created so that others can easily find it? \nAlong the way, we will study the design of existing corpora, the typical workflow for creating a corpus, and the life cycle of a corpus. As in other chapters, there will be many examples drawn from practical experience managing linguistic data, including data that has been collected in the course of linguistic fieldwork, laboratory work, and web crawling. \n11.1  Corpus Structure: A Case Study \nThe TIMIT Corpus was the first annotated speech database to be widely distributed, and it has an especially clear organization.

For each of eight dialect regions, 50 male and female speakers having a range of ages and educational backgrounds each read 10 carefully chosen sentences. Two sentences, read by all speakers, were designed to bring out dialect variation: \n(1) a. she had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year b. don’t ask me to carry an oily rag like that \nThe remaining sentences were chosen to be phonetically rich, involving all phones (sounds) and a comprehensive range of diphones (phone bigrams). Additionally, the design strikes a balance between multiple speakers saying the same sentence in order to permit comparison across speakers, and having a large range of sentences covered by the corpus to get maximal coverage of diphones. Five of the sentences read by each speaker are also read by six other speakers (for comparability). The remaining three sentences read by each speaker were unique to that speaker (for coverage). \nNLTK includes a sample from the TIMIT Corpus. You can access its documentation in the usual way, using help(nltk.corpus.timit). Print nltk.corpus.timit.fileids() to see a list of the 160 recorded utterances in the corpus sample.

First, the corpus contains two layers of annotation, at the phonetic and orthographic levels. In general, a text or speech corpus may be annotated at many different linguistic levels, including morphological, syntactic, and discourse levels. Moreover, even at a given level there may be different labeling schemes or even disagreement among annotators, such that we want to represent multiple versions. A second property of TIMIT is its balance across multiple dimensions of variation, for coverage of dialect regions and diphones. The inclusion of speaker demographics brings in many more independent variables that may help to account for variation in the data, and which facilitate later uses of the corpus for purposes that were not envisaged when the corpus was created, such as sociolinguistics. A third property is that there is a sharp division between the original linguistic event captured as an audio recording and the annotations of that event. The same holds true of text corpora, in the sense that the original text usually has an external source, and is considered to be an immutable artifact. Any transformations of that artifact which involve human judgment—even something as simple as tokenization—are subject to later revision; thus it is important to retain the source material in a form that is as close to the original as possible. \nA fourth feature of TIMIT is the hierarchical structure of the corpus. With 4 files per sentence, and 10 sentences for each of 500 speakers, there are 20,000 files. These are organized into a tree structure, shown schematically in Figure 11-2. At the top level there is a split between training and testing sets, which gives away its intended use for developing and evaluating statistical models.",

The inclusion of speaker demographics brings in many more independent variables that may help to account for variation in the data, and which facilitate later uses of the corpus for purposes that were not envisaged when the corpus was created, such as sociolinguistics. A third property is that there is a sharp division between the original linguistic event captured as an audio recording and the annotations of that event. The same holds true of text corpora, in the sense that the original text usually has an external source, and is considered to be an immutable artifact. Any transformations of that artifact which involve human judgment—even something as simple as tokenization—are subject to later revision; thus it is important to retain the source material in a form that is as close to the original as possible. \nA fourth feature of TIMIT is the hierarchical structure of the corpus. With 4 files per sentence, and 10 sentences for each of 500 speakers, there are 20,000 files. These are organized into a tree structure, shown schematically in Figure 11-2. At the top level there is a split between training and testing sets, which gives away its intended use for developing and evaluating statistical models. \n\nFinally, notice that even though TIMIT is a speech corpus, its transcriptions and associated data are just text, and can be processed using programs just like any other text corpus. Therefore, many of the computational methods described in this book are applicable. Moreover, notice that all of the data types included in the TIMIT Corpus fall into the two basic categories of lexicon and text, which we will discuss later. Even the speaker demographics data is just another instance of the lexicon data type. \nThis last observation is less surprising when we consider that text and record structures are the primary domains for the two subfields of computer science that focus on data management, namely text retrieval and databases. A notable feature of linguistic data management is that it usually brings both data types together, and that it can draw on results and techniques from both fields. \nFundamental Data Types \nDespite its complexity, the TIMIT Corpus contains only two fundamental data types, namely lexicons and texts. As we saw in Chapter 2, most lexical resources can be represented using a record structure, i.e., a key plus one or more fields, as shown in Figure 11-3. A lexical resource could be a conventional dictionary or comparative wordlist, as illustrated. It could also be a phrasal lexicon, where the key field is a phrase rather than a single word. A thesaurus also consists of record-structured data, where we look up entries via non-key fields that correspond to topics. We can also construct special tabulations (known as paradigms) to illustrate contrasts and systematic variation, as shown in Figure 11-3 for three verbs. TIMIT’s speaker table is also a kind of lexicon. \nLexicon Text   \nAbstraction: fielded records Abstraction: time series   \nkey field field field field token token token   \nkey field field field field attrs attrs attrs   \ntime   \nEg: dictionary Eg:written text   \nwake: weik,[v], cease to sle..

For an agreement of $5 0 %$ , we would get $kappa = 0 . 3 3 3$ , as 50 is a third of the way from 25 to 100. Many other agreement measures exist; see help(nltk.metrics.agreement) for details. \nWe can also measure the agreement between two independent segmentations of language input, e.g., for tokenization, sentence segmentation, and named entity recognition. In Figure 11-4 we see three possible segmentations of a sequence of items which might have been produced by annotators (or programs). Although none of them agree exactly, $S _ { 1 }$ and $S _ { 2 }$ are in close agreement, and we would like a suitable measure. Windowdiff is a simple algorithm for evaluating the agreement of two segmentations by running a sliding window over the data and awarding partial credit for near misses. If we preprocess our tokens into a sequence of zeros and ones, to record when a token is followed by a boundary, we can represent the segmentations as strings and apply the windowdiff scorer. \n>>> s1 = \"00000010000000001000000\"   \n>>> s2 = \"00000001000000010000000\"   \n>>> s3 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"00010000000000000001000\"   \n>>> nltk.windowdiff(s1, s1, 3)   \n0   \n$gg >$ nltk.windowdiff(s1, s2, 3)   \n4   \n>>> nltk.windowdiff(s2, s3, 3)   \n16 \nIn this example, the window had a size of 3.

At each position it totals up the number of boundaries found inside this window, for both strings, then computes the difference. These differences are then summed. We can increase or shrink the window size to control the sensitivity of the measure. \nCuration Versus Evolution \nAs large corpora are published, researchers are increasingly likely to base their investigations on balanced, focused subsets that were derived from corpora produced for entirely different reasons. For instance, the Switchboard database, originally collected for speaker identification research, has since been used as the basis for published studies in speech recognition, word pronunciation, disfluency, syntax, intonation, and discourse structure.

The process of choosing a subset for such a study may count as a non-trivial contribution in itself. \n\nIn addition to selecting an appropriate subset of a corpus, this new work could involve reformatting a text file (e.g., converting to XML), renaming files, retokenizing the text, selecting a subset of the data to enrich, and so forth. Multiple research groups might do this work independently, as illustrated in Figure 11-5. At a later date, should someone want to combine sources of information from different versions, the task will probably be extremely onerous. \nResearch Group 1: Research Group 3: discard tags, retokenize, select subset of sentences   \nPublished annotatenamed-entities andannotatecoreference Discourse   \ncorpus: Research:   \ntokenized combining   \nandtagged Research Group 2: Research Group 4: sources??? sentencesegmentation, selectsubsetofsentences discard punctuation, parse and label semantic roles \nThe task of using derived corpora is made even more difficult by the lack of any record about how the derived version was created, and which version is the most up-to-date. \nAn alternative to this chaotic situation is for a corpus to be centrally curated, and for committees of experts to revise and extend it at periodic intervals, considering submissions from third parties and publishing new releases from time to time. Print dictionaries and national corpora may be centrally curated in this way. However, for most corpora this model is simply impractical. \nA middle course is for the original corpus publication to have a scheme for identifying any sub-part. Each sentence, tree, or lexical entry could have a globally unique identifier, and each token, node, or field (respectively) could have a relative offset. Annotations, including segmentations, could reference the source using this identifier scheme (a method which is known as standoff annotation). This way, new annotations could be distributed independently of the source, and multiple independent annotations of the same source could be compared and updated without touching the source. \nIf the corpus publication is provided in multiple versions, the version number or date could be part of the identification scheme. A table of correspondences between identifiers across editions of the corpus would permit any standoff annotations to be updated easily. \n\nCaution! \nSometimes an updated corpus contains revisions of base material that has been externally annotated. Tokens might be split or merged, and constituents may have been rearranged. There may not be a one-to-one correspondence between old and new identifiers. It is better to cause standoff annotations to break on such components of the new version than to silently allow their identifiers to refer to incorrect locations. \n11.3  Acquiring Data \nObtaining Data from the Web \nThe Web is a rich source of data for language analysis purposes. We have already discussed methods for accessing individual files, RSS feeds, and search engine results (see Section 3.1). However, in some cases we want to obtain large quantities of web text. \nThe simplest approach is to obtain a published corpus of web text. The ACL Special Interest Group on Web as Corpus (SIGWAC) maintains a list of resources at http:// www.sigwac.org.uk/. The advantage of using a well-defined web corpus is that they are documented, stable, and permit reproducible experimentation. \nIf the desired content is localized to a particular website, there are many utilities for capturing all the accessible contents of a site, such as GNU Wget (http://www.gnu.org/ software/wget/). For maximal flexibility and control, a web crawler can be used, such as Heritrix (http://crawler.archive.org/). Crawlers permit fine-grained control over where to look, which links to follow, and how to organize the results. For example, if we want to compile a bilingual text collection having corresponding pairs of documents in each language, the crawler needs to detect the structure of the site in order to extract the correspondence between the documents, and it needs to organize the downloaded pages in such a way that the correspondence is captured. It might be tempting to write your own web crawler, but there are dozens of pitfalls having to do with detecting MIME types, converting relative to absolute URLs, avoiding getting trapped in cyclic link structures, dealing with network latencies, avoiding overloading the site or being banned from accessing the site, and so on. \nObtaining Data from Word Processor Files \nWord processing software is often used in the manual preparation of texts and lexicons in projects that have limited computational infrastructure. Such projects often provide templates for data entry, though the word processing software does not ensure that the data is correctly structured. For example, each text may be required to have a title and date. Similarly, each lexical entry may have certain obligatory fields. As the data grows in size and complexity, a larger proportion of time may be spent maintaining its consistency.",

It might be tempting to write your own web crawler, but there are dozens of pitfalls having to do with detecting MIME types, converting relative to absolute URLs, avoiding getting trapped in cyclic link structures, dealing with network latencies, avoiding overloading the site or being banned from accessing the site, and so on. \nObtaining Data from Word Processor Files \nWord processing software is often used in the manual preparation of texts and lexicons in projects that have limited computational infrastructure. Such projects often provide templates for data entry, though the word processing software does not ensure that the data is correctly structured. For example, each text may be required to have a title and date. Similarly, each lexical entry may have certain obligatory fields. As the data grows in size and complexity, a larger proportion of time may be spent maintaining its consistency. \n\nHow can we extract the content of such files so that we can manipulate it in external programs? Moreover, how can we validate the content of these files to help authors create well-structured data, so that the quality of the data can be maximized in the context of the original authoring process? \nConsider a dictionary in which each entry has a part-of-speech field, drawn from a set of 20 possibilities, displayed after the pronunciation field, and rendered in 11-point bold type. No conventional word processor has search or macro functions capable of verifying that all part-of-speech fields have been correctly entered and displayed. This task requires exhaustive manual checking. If the word processor permits the document to be saved in a non-proprietary format, such as text, HTML, or XML, we can sometimes write programs to do this checking automatically. \nConsider the following fragment of a lexical entry: “sleep [sli:p] v.i. condition of body and mind...”. We can key in such text using MSWord, then “Save as Web Page,” then inspect the resulting HTML file: \n<p class=MsoNormal>sleep <span style $ c =$ 'mso-spacerun:yes'> </span> [<span class $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ SpellE>sli:p</span>] <span style $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ 'mso-spacerun:yes'> </span> <b><span style $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ 'font-size:11.0pt'>v.i.</span></b> <span style $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ 'mso-spacerun:yes'> </span> <i>a condition of body and mind ...<o:p></o:p></i>   \n</p> \nObserve that the entry is represented as an HTML paragraph, using the <p> element, and that the part of speech appears inside a <span style $mathbf { Sigma } = mathbf { Sigma }$ 'font-size:11.0pt'> element. The following program defines the set of legal parts-of-speech, legal_pos. Then it extracts all 11-point content from the dict.htm file and stores it in the set used_pos. Observe that the search pattern contains a parenthesized sub-expression; only the material that matches this subexpression is returned by re.findall. Finally, the program constructs the set of illegal parts-of-speech as the set difference between used_pos and legal_pos: \n>>> legal_pos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ set(['n', 'v.t.', 'v.i.', 'adj', 'det'])   \n>>> pattern $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ re.compile(r\"'font-size:11.0pt'>([a-z.]+)<\")   \n>>> document $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ open(\"dict.htm\").read()   \n>>> used_pos $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ set(re.findall(pattern, document))   \n$gg >$ illegal_pos $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ used_pos.difference(legal_pos)   \n>>> print list(illegal_pos)   \n['v.i', 'intrans'] \nThis simple program represents the tip of the iceberg. We can develop sophisticated tools to check the consistency of word processor files, and report errors so that the maintainer of the dictionary can correct the original file using the original word processor. \nOnce we know the data is correctly formatted, we can write other programs to convert the data into a different format. The program in Example 11-1 strips out the HTML markup using nltk.clean_html(), extracts the words and their pronunciations, and generates output in “comma-separated value” (CSV) format. \nExample 11-1. Converting HTML created by Microsoft Word into comma-separated values. \ndef lexical_data(html_file): $S E P = 1$ _ENTRY' html $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ open(html_file).read() html $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ re.sub(r'<p', SEP + '<p', html) text $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ nltk.clean_html(html) text $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ' '.join(text.split()) for entry in text.split(SEP): if entry.count $( ^ { cdot cdot } ) > 2$ : yield entry.split(' ', 3) \n>>> import csv >>> writer $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ csv.writer(open(\"dict1.csv\", \"wb\")) >>> writer.writerows(lexical_data(\"dict.htm\")) \nObtaining Data from Spreadsheets and Databases \nSpreadsheets are often used for acquiring wordlists or paradigms. For example, a comparative wordlist may be created using a spreadsheet, with a row for each cognate set and a column for each language (see nltk.corpus.swadesh and www.rosettapro ject.org). Most spreadsheet software can export their data in CSV format. As we will see later, it is easy for Python programs to access these using the csv module. \nSometimes lexicons are stored in a full-fledged relational database. When properly normalized, these databases can ensure the validity of the data. For example, we can require that all parts-of-speech come from a specified vocabulary by declaring that the part-of-speech field is an enumerated type or a foreign key that references a separate part-of-speech table. However, the relational model requires the structure of the data (the schema) be declared in advance, and this runs counter to the dominant approach to structuring linguistic data, which is highly exploratory. Fields which were assumed to be obligatory and unique often turn out to be optional and repeatable. A relational database can accommodate this when it is fully known in advance; however, if it is not, or if just about every property turns out to be optional or repeatable, the relational approach is unworkable. \nNevertheless, when our goal is simply to extract the contents from a database, it is enough to dump out the tables (or SQL query results) in CSV format and load them into our program. Our program might perform a linguistically motivated query that cannot easily be expressed in SQL, e.g., select all words that appear in example sentences for which no dictionary entry is provided. For this task, we would need to extract enough information from a record for it to be uniquely identified, along with the headwords and example sentences.

The challenge for NLP is to write programs that cope with the generality of such formats. For example, if the programming task involves tree data, and the file format permits arbitrary directed graphs, then input data must be validated to check for tree properties such as rootedness, connectedness, and acyclicity. If the input files contain other layers of annotation, the program would need to know how to ignore them when the data was loaded, but not invalidate or obliterate those layers when the tree data was saved back to the file.",

In response to this, many linguists are hard at work documenting the languages, constructing rich records of this important facet of the world’s linguistic heritage. What can the field of NLP offer to help with this effort? Developing taggers, parsers, named entity recognizers, etc., is not an early priority, and there is usually insufficient data for developing such tools in any case. Instead, the most frequently voiced need is to have better tools for collecting and curating data, with a focus on texts and lexicons. \nOn the face of things, it should be a straightforward matter to start collecting texts in an endangered language. Even if we ignore vexed issues such as who owns the texts, and sensitivities surrounding cultural knowledge contained in the texts, there is the obvious practical issue of transcription. Most languages lack a standard orthography. When a language has no literary tradition, the conventions of spelling and punctuation are not well established. Therefore it is common practice to create a lexicon in tandem with a text collection, continually updating the lexicon as new words appear in the texts. This work could be done using a text processor (for the texts) and a spreadsheet (for the lexicon). Better still, SIL’s free linguistic software Toolbox and Fieldworks provide sophisticated support for integrated creation of texts and lexicons. \nWhen speakers of the language in question are trained to enter texts themselves, a common obstacle is an overriding concern for correct spelling. Having a lexicon greatly helps this process, but we need to have lookup methods that do not assume someone can determine the citation form of an arbitrary word. The problem may be acute for languages having a complex morphology that includes prefixes. In such cases it helps to tag lexical items with semantic domains, and to permit lookup by semantic domain or by gloss. \nPermitting lookup by pronunciation similarity is also a big help. Here’s a simple demonstration of how to do this. The first step is to identify confusible letter sequences, and map complex versions to simpler versions. We might also notice that the relative order of letters within a cluster of consonants is a source of spelling errors, and so we normalize the order of consonants. \n>>> mappings $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [('ph', 'f'), ('ght', 't'), ('^kn', 'n'), ('qu', 'kw'), ('[aeiou]+', 'a'), (r'(.)1', r'1')]   \n>>> def signature(word): for patt, repl in mappings: word $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ re.sub(patt, repl, word) pieces $mathbf { tau } = mathbf { tau }$ re.findall('[^aeiou]+', word) return ''.join(char for piece in pieces for char in sorted(piece))[:8]   \n>>> signature('illefent')   \n'lfnt'   \n>>> signature('ebsekwieous')   \n'bskws'   \n>>> signature('nuculerr')   \n'nclr' \nNext, we create a mapping from signatures to words, for all the words in our lexicon. We can use this to get candidate corrections for a given input word (but we must first compute that word’s signature). \n>>> signatures $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.Index((signature(w), w) for $w$ in nltk.corpus.words.words()) >>> signatures[signature('nuculerr')] ['anicular', 'inocular', 'nucellar', 'nuclear', 'unicolor', 'uniocular', 'unocular'] \nFinally, we should rank the results in terms of similarity with the original word. This is done by the function rank(). The only remaining function provides a simple interface to the user: \n>>> def rank(word, wordlist): ranked $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ sorted((nltk.edit_dist(word, w), w) for $w$ in wordlist) return [word for (_, word) in ranked]   \n>>> def fuzzy_spell(word): sig $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ signature(word) if sig in signatures: return rank(word, signatures[sig]) else: return []   \n>>> fuzzy_spell('illefent')   \n['olefiant', 'elephant', 'oliphant', 'elephanta']   \n>>> fuzzy_spell('ebsekwieous')   \n['obsequious']   \n>>> fuzzy_spell('nucular')   \n['nuclear', 'nucellar', 'anicular', 'inocular', 'unocular', 'unicolor', 'un \nThis is just one illustration where a simple program can facilitate access to lexical data in a context where the writing system of a language may not be standardized, or where users of the language may not have a good command of spellings. Other simple applications of NLP in this area include building indexes to facilitate access to data, gleaning wordlists from texts, locating examples of word usage in constructing a lexicon, detecting prevalent or exceptional patterns in poorly understood data, and performing specialized validation on data created using various linguistic software tools. We will return to the last of these in Section 11.5. \n11.4  Working with XML \nThe Extensible Markup Language (XML) provides a framework for designing domainspecific markup languages. It is sometimes used for representing annotated text and for lexical resources. Unlike HTML with its predefined tags, XML permits us to make up our own tags. Unlike a database, XML permits us to create data without first specifying its structure, and it permits us to have optional and repeatable elements. In this section, we briefly review some features of XML that are relevant for representing linguistic data, and show how to access data stored in XML files using Python programs. \nUsing XML for Linguistic Structures \nThanks to its flexibility and extensibility, XML is a natural choice for representing linguistic structures. Here’s an example of a simple lexical entry. \n(2) <entry> <headword>whale</headword> <pos>noun</pos> <gloss>any of the larger cetacean mammals having a streamlined body and breathing through a blowhole on the head</gloss> </entry> \nIt consists of a series of XML tags enclosed in angle brackets. Each opening tag, such as <gloss>, is matched with a closing tag, </gloss>; together they constitute an XML element. The preceding example has been laid out nicely using whitespace, but it could equally have been put on a single long line. Our approach to processing XML will usually not be sensitive to whitespace. In order for XML to be well formed, all opening tags must have corresponding closing tags, at the same level of nesting (i.e., the XML document must be a well-formed tree). \nXML permits us to repeat elements, e.g., to add another gloss field, as we see next. We will use different whitespace to underscore the point that layout does not matter. \n(3) <entry><headword>whale</headword><pos>noun</pos><gloss>any of the larger cetacean mammals having a streamlined body and breathing through a blowhole on the head</gloss><gloss>a very large person; impressive in size or qualities</gloss></entry> \nA further step might be to link our lexicon to some external resource, such as WordNet, using external identifiers. In (4) we group the gloss and a synset identifier inside a new element, which we have called “sense.” \n(4) <entry> <headword>whale</headword> <pos>noun</pos> <sense> <gloss>any of the larger cetacean mammals having a streamlined body and breathing through a blowhole on the head</gloss> <synset>whale.n.02</synset>",

If it seems somewhat arbitrary, that’s because it is! Following the rules of XML, we can invent new attribute names, and nest them as deeply as we like. We can repeat elements, leave them out, and put them in a different order each time. We can have fields whose presence depends on the value of some other field; e.g., if the part of speech is verb, then the entry can have a past_tense element to hold the past tense of the verb, but if the part of speech is noun, no past_tense element is permitted. To impose some order over all this freedom, we can constrain the structure of an XML file using a “schema,” which is a declaration akin to a context-free grammar. Tools exist for testing the validity of an XML file with respect to a schema. \nThe Role of XML \nWe can use XML to represent many kinds of linguistic information. However, the flexibility comes at a price. Each time we introduce a complication, such as by permitting an element to be optional or repeated, we make more work for any program that accesses the data. We also make it more difficult to check the validity of the data, or to interrogate the data using one of the XML query languages. \nThus, using XML to represent linguistic structures does not magically solve the data modeling problem. We still have to work out how to structure the data, then define that structure with a schema, and then write programs to read and write the format and convert it to other formats. Similarly, we still need to follow some standard principles concerning data normalization. It is wise to avoid making duplicate copies of the same information, so that we don’t end up with inconsistent data when only one copy is changed. For example, a cross-reference that was represented as <xref>headword</ xref> would duplicate the storage of the headword of some other lexical entry, and the link would break if the copy of the string at the other location was modified. Existential dependencies between information types need to be modeled, so that we can’t create elements without a home. For example, if sense definitions cannot exist independently of a lexical entry, the sense element can be nested inside the entry element. Many-tomany relations need to be abstracted out of hierarchical structures. For example, if a word can have many corresponding senses, and a sense can have several corresponding words, then both words and senses must be enumerated separately, as must the list of (word, sense) pairings. This complex structure might even be split across three separate XML files.",

ElementTree is part of Python’s standard library (since Python 2.5), and is also provided as part of NLTK in case you are using Python 2.4. \nWe will illustrate the use of ElementTree using a collection of Shakespeare plays that have been formatted using XML.

For a list, see nltk.corpus.shakespeare.fileids(). \nAlthough we can access the entire tree this way, it is more convenient to search for subelements with particular names. Recall that the elements at the top level have several types. We can iterate over just the types we are interested in (such as the acts), using merchant.findall('ACT'). Here’s an example of doing such tag-specific searches at every level of nesting: \n>>> for i, act in enumerate(merchant.findall('ACT')): for j, scene in enumerate(act.findall('SCENE')): for k, speech in enumerate(scene.findall('SPEECH')): for line in speech.findall('LINE'): if 'music' in str(line.text): print \"Act %d Scene %d Speech %d: %s\" % ( $mathbf { i } { + } 1$ , ${ mathfrak { j } } { + } 1$ , $k { + } 1$ , line.text)   \nAct 3 Scene 2 Speech 9: Let music sound while he doth make his choice;   \nAct 3 Scene 2 Speech 9: Fading in music: that the comparison   \nAct 3 Scene 2 Speech 9: And what is music then?

Act 5 Scene 1 Speech 32: No better a musician than the wren. \nInstead of navigating each step of the way down the hierarchy, we can search for particular embedded elements. For example, let’s examine the sequence of speakers. We can use a frequency distribution to see who has the most to say: \n>>> speaker_seq $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [s.text for s in merchant.findall('ACT/SCENE/SPEECH/SPEAKER')]   \n>>> speaker_freq $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.FreqDist(speaker_seq)   \n>>> top5 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ speaker_freq.keys()[:5]   \n>>> top5   \n['PORTIA', 'SHYLOCK', 'BASSANIO', 'GRATIANO', 'ANTONIO'] \nWe can also look for patterns in who follows whom in the dialogues. Since there are 23 speakers, we need to reduce the “vocabulary” to a manageable size first, using the method described in Section 5.3. \n>>> mapping $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.defaultdict(lambda: 'OTH')   \n$gg gg$ for s in top5: mapping[s] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ s[:4]   \n>>> speaker_seq2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [mapping[s] for s in speaker_seq]   \n>>> cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(nltk.ibigrams(speaker_seq2))   \n>>> cfd.tabulate() ANTO BASS GRAT OTH PORT SHYL   \nANTO 0 11 4 11 9 12   \nBASS 10 0 11 10 26 16   \nGRAT 6 8 0 19 9 5   \nOTH 8 16 18 153 52 25   \nPORT 7 23 13 53 0 21   \nSHYL 15 15 2 26 21 0 \nIgnoring the entry of 153 for exchanges between people other than the top five, the largest values suggest that Othello and Portia have the most significant interactions. \nUsing ElementTree for Accessing Toolbox Data \nIn Section 2.4, we saw a simple interface for accessing Toolbox data, a popular and well-established format used by linguists for managing data. In this section, we discuss a variety of techniques for manipulating Toolbox data in ways that are not supported by the Toolbox software. The methods we discuss could be applied to other recordstructured data, regardless of the actual file format. \nWe can use the toolbox.xml() method to access a Toolbox file and load it into an ElementTree object.

Since there are 23 speakers, we need to reduce the “vocabulary” to a manageable size first, using the method described in Section 5.3. \n>>> mapping $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.defaultdict(lambda: 'OTH')   \n$gg gg$ for s in top5: mapping[s] $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ s[:4]   \n>>> speaker_seq2 $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [mapping[s] for s in speaker_seq]   \n>>> cfd $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.ConditionalFreqDist(nltk.ibigrams(speaker_seq2))   \n>>> cfd.tabulate() ANTO BASS GRAT OTH PORT SHYL   \nANTO 0 11 4 11 9 12   \nBASS 10 0 11 10 26 16   \nGRAT 6 8 0 19 9 5   \nOTH 8 16 18 153 52 25   \nPORT 7 23 13 53 0 21   \nSHYL 15 15 2 26 21 0 \nIgnoring the entry of 153 for exchanges between people other than the top five, the largest values suggest that Othello and Portia have the most significant interactions. \nUsing ElementTree for Accessing Toolbox Data \nIn Section 2.4, we saw a simple interface for accessing Toolbox data, a popular and well-established format used by linguists for managing data. In this section, we discuss a variety of techniques for manipulating Toolbox data in ways that are not supported by the Toolbox software. The methods we discuss could be applied to other recordstructured data, regardless of the actual file format. \nWe can use the toolbox.xml() method to access a Toolbox file and load it into an ElementTree object. This file contains a lexicon for the Rotokas language of Papua New Guinea. \n>>> from nltk.corpus import toolbox >>> lexicon $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ toolbox.xml('rotokas.dic') \nThere are two ways to access the contents of the lexicon object: by indexes and by paths. Indexes use the familiar syntax; thus lexicon[3] returns entry number 3 (which is actually the fourth entry counting from zero) and lexicon[3][0] returns its first field: \n>>> lexicon[3][0]   \n<Element lx at 77bd28> >>> lexicon[3][0].tag 'lx'   \n>>> lexicon[3][0].text 'kaa' \nThe second way to access the contents of the lexicon object uses paths. The lexicon is a series of record objects, each containing a series of field objects, such as lx and ps. We can conveniently address all of the lexemes using the path record/lx. Here we use the findall() function to search for any matches to the path record/lx, and we access the text content of the element, normalizing it to lowercase: \n>>> [lexeme.text.lower() for lexeme in lexicon.findall('record/lx')] ['kaa', 'kaa', 'kaa', 'kaakaaro', 'kaakaaviko', 'kaakaavo', 'kaakaoko', 'kaakasi', 'kaakau', 'kaakauko', 'kaakito', 'kaakuupato', ..., 'kuvuto'] \nLet’s view the Toolbox data in XML format. The write() method of ElementTree expects a file object. We usually create one of these using Python’s built-in open() function. In order to see the output displayed on the screen, we can use a special predefined file object called stdout $bullet$ (standard output), defined in Python’s sys module. \n>>> import sys   \n>>> from nltk.etree.ElementTree import ElementTree   \n>>> tree $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ElementTree(lexicon[3])   \n>>> tree.write(sys.stdout)   \n<record> <lx>kaa</lx> <ps>N</ps> <pt>MASC</pt> <cl>isi</cl> <ge>cooking banana</ge> <tkp>banana bilong kukim</tkp> <pt>itoo</pt> <sf>FLORA</sf> <dt>12/Aug/2005</dt> <ex>Taeavi iria kaa isi kovopaueva kaparapasia.</ex> <xp>Taeavi i bin planim gaden banana bilong kukim tasol long paia.</xp> <xe>Taeavi planted banana in order to cook it.</xe>   \n</record> \nFormatting Entries \nWe can use the same idea we saw in the previous section to generate HTML tables instead of plain text. This would be useful for publishing a Toolbox lexicon on the Web. It produces HTML elements <table>, <tr> (table row), and <td> (table data).",

Many of the methods discussed in previous chapters, such as counting, building frequency distributions, and tabulating co-occurrences, can be applied to the content of Toolbox entries. For example, we can trivially compute the average number of fields for each entry: \n>>> from nltk.corpus import toolbox   \n>>> lexicon $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ toolbox.xml('rotokas.dic')   \n>>> sum(len(entry) for entry in lexicon) / len(lexicon)   \n13.635955056179775 \nIn this section, we will discuss two tasks that arise in the context of documentary linguistics, neither of which is supported by the Toolbox software. \nAdding a Field to Each Entry \nIt is often convenient to add new fields that are derived automatically from existing ones. Such fields often facilitate search and analysis. For instance, in Example 11-2 we define a function $mathsf { c v ( ) }$ , which maps a string of consonants and vowels to the corresponding CV sequence, e.g., kakapua would map to CVCVCVV. This mapping has four steps. First, the string is converted to lowercase, then we replace any non-alphabetic characters $[ neg mathsf { a }  – mathsf { z } ]$ with an underscore. Next, we replace all vowels with V. Finally, anything that is not a $mathsf { V }$ or an underscore must be a consonant, so we replace it with a C. Now, we can scan the lexicon and add a new cv field after every lx field. Example 11-2 shows what this does to a particular entry; note the last line of output, which shows the new cv field.",

The grammar in Example 11-3 uses the CFG format we saw in Chapter 8. Such a grammar models the implicit nested structure of Toolbox entries, building a tree structure, where the leaves of the tree are individual field names. We iterate over the entries and report their conformance with the grammar, as shown in Example 11-3. Those that are accepted by the grammar are prefixed with a $because 0$ , and those that are rejected are prefixed with a $cdots 0$ . During the process of developing such a grammar, it helps to filter out some of the tags $bullet$ . \nExample 11-3. Validating Toolbox entries using a context-free grammar. \ngrammar $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.parse_cfg(' S -> Head PS Glosses Comment Date Sem_Field Examples Head -> Lexeme Root Lexeme -> \"lx\" Root -> \"rt\" | PS -> \"ps\" Glosses -> Gloss Glosses | Gloss -> \"ge\" | \"tkp\" | \"eng\" Date -> \"dt\" Sem_Field -> \"sf\" Examples -> Example Ex_Pidgin Ex_English Examples | Example -> \"ex\" Ex_Pidgin -> \"xp\" Ex_English -> \"xe\" Comment -> \"cmt\" | \"nt\" | ''') \ndef validate_lexicon(grammar, lexicon, ignored_tags): rd_parser $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ nltk.RecursiveDescentParser(grammar) for entry in lexicon: marker_list $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ [field.tag for field in entry if field.tag not in ignored_tags] if rd_parser.nbest_parse(marker_list): print \"+\", ':'.join(marker_list) else: print \"-\", ':'.join(marker_list) \n>>> lexicon $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ toolbox.xml('rotokas.dic')[10:20]   \n>>> ignored_tags $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ ['arg', 'dcsv', 'pt', 'vx']   \n>>> validate_lexicon(grammar, lexicon, ignored_tags)   \n- lx:ps:ge:tkp:sf:nt:dt:ex:xp:xe:ex:xp:xe:ex:xp:xe   \n- lx:rt:ps:ge:tkp:nt:dt:ex:xp:xe:ex:xp:xe   \n- lx:ps:ge:tkp:nt:dt:ex:xp:xe:ex:xp:xe   \n- lx:ps:ge:tkp:nt:sf:dt   \n- lx:ps:ge:tkp:dt:cmt:ex:xp:xe:ex:xp:xe   \n- lx:ps:ge:ge:ge:tkp:cmt:dt:ex:xp:xe   \n- lx:rt:ps:ge:ge:tkp:dt   \n- lx:rt:ps:ge:eng:eng:eng:ge:tkp:tkp:dt:cmt:ex:xp:xe:ex:xp:xe:ex:xp:xe:ex:xp:xe:ex:xp:xe   \n- lx:rt:ps:ge:tkp:dt:ex:xp:xe   \n- lx:ps:ge:ge:tkp:dt:ex:xp:xe:ex:xp:xe \nAnother approach would be to use a chunk parser (Chapter 7), since these are much more effective at identifying partial structures and can report the partial structures that have been identified. In Example 11-4 we set up a chunk grammar for the entries of a lexicon, then parse each entry. A sample of the output from this program is shown in Figure 11-7. \nExample 11-4.

The solution which has been developed by the Digital Libraries community involves metadata aggregation. \nWhat Is Metadata? \nThe simplest definition of metadata is “structured data about data.” Metadata is descriptive information about an object or resource, whether it be physical or electronic. Although the term “metadata” itself is relatively new, the underlying concepts behind metadata have been in use for as long as collections of information have been organized. Library catalogs represent a well-established type of metadata; they have served as collection management and resource discovery tools for decades. Metadata can be generated either “by hand” or automatically using software. \nThe Dublin Core Metadata Initiative began in 1995 to develop conventions for finding, sharing, and managing information. The Dublin Core metadata elements represent a broad, interdisciplinary consensus about the core set of elements that are likely to be widely useful to support resource discovery. The Dublin Core consists of 15 metadata elements, where each element is optional and repeatable: Title, Creator, Subject, Description, Publisher, Contributor, Date, Type, Format, Identifier, Source, Language, Relation, Coverage, and Rights. This metadata set can be used to describe resources that exist in digital or traditional formats. \nThe Open Archives Initiative (OAI) provides a common framework across digital repositories of scholarly materials, regardless of their type, including documents, data, software, recordings, physical artifacts, digital surrogates, and so forth. Each repository consists of a network-accessible server offering public access to archived items. Each item has a unique identifier, and is associated with a Dublin Core metadata record (and possibly additional records in other formats). The OAI defines a protocol for metadata search services to “harvest” the contents of repositories. \nOLAC: Open Language Archives Community \nThe Open Language Archives Community, or OLAC, is an international partnership of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by: (i) developing consensus on best current practices for the digital archiving of language resources, and (ii) developing a network of interoperating repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources. OLAC’s home on the Web is at http: //www.language-archives.org/. \nOLAC Metadata is a standard for describing language resources.

The Dublin Core metadata elements represent a broad, interdisciplinary consensus about the core set of elements that are likely to be widely useful to support resource discovery. The Dublin Core consists of 15 metadata elements, where each element is optional and repeatable: Title, Creator, Subject, Description, Publisher, Contributor, Date, Type, Format, Identifier, Source, Language, Relation, Coverage, and Rights. This metadata set can be used to describe resources that exist in digital or traditional formats. \nThe Open Archives Initiative (OAI) provides a common framework across digital repositories of scholarly materials, regardless of their type, including documents, data, software, recordings, physical artifacts, digital surrogates, and so forth. Each repository consists of a network-accessible server offering public access to archived items. Each item has a unique identifier, and is associated with a Dublin Core metadata record (and possibly additional records in other formats). The OAI defines a protocol for metadata search services to “harvest” the contents of repositories. \nOLAC: Open Language Archives Community \nThe Open Language Archives Community, or OLAC, is an international partnership of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by: (i) developing consensus on best current practices for the digital archiving of language resources, and (ii) developing a network of interoperating repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources. OLAC’s home on the Web is at http: //www.language-archives.org/. \nOLAC Metadata is a standard for describing language resources. Uniform description across repositories is ensured by limiting the values of certain metadata elements to the use of terms from controlled vocabularies. OLAC metadata can be used to describe data and tools, in both physical and digital formats. OLAC metadata extends the \nDublin Core Metadata Set, a widely accepted standard for describing resources of all types. To this core set, OLAC adds descriptors to cover fundamental properties of language resources, such as subject language and linguistic type. Here’s an example of a complete OLAC record: \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding $ c =$ \"UTF-8\"?>   \n<olac:olac xmlns:olac $ c =$ \"http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.1/\" xmlns $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:dcterms $ c =$ \"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" xmlns:xsi $mathbf { sigma } = mathbf { sigma }$ \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation $ c =$ \"http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.1/ http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.1/olac.xsd\"> <title>A grammar of Kayardild.

In addition to this software infrastructure, OLAC has documented a series of best practices for describing language resources, through a process that involved extended consultation with the language resources community (e.g., see http://www.language-archives.org/ REC/bpr.html). \nOLAC repositories can be searched using a query engine on the OLAC website. Searching for “German lexicon” finds the following resources, among others: \n• CALLHOME German Lexicon, at http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai: www.ldc.upenn.edu:LDC97L18 MULTILEX multilingual lexicon, at http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai:el ra.icp.inpg.fr:M0001   \n• Slelex Siemens Phonetic lexicon, at http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai:elra .icp.inpg.fr:S0048 \nSearching for “Korean” finds a newswire corpus, and a treebank, a lexicon, a childlanguage corpus, and interlinear glossed texts. It also finds software, including a syntactic analyzer and a morphological analyzer. \nObserve that the previous URLs include a substring of the form: oai:www.ldc.upenn.edu:LDC97L18. This is an OAI identifier, using a URI scheme registered with ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). These identifiers have the format oai:archive:local_id, where oai is the name of the URI scheme, archive is an archive identifier, such as www.ldc.upenn.edu, and local_id is the resource identifier assigned by the archive, e.g., LDC97L18. \n\nGiven an OAI identifier for an OLAC resource, it is possible to retrieve the complete XML record for the resource using a URL of the following form: http://www.languagearchives.org/static-records/oai:archive:local_id. \n11.7  Summary \nFundamental data types, present in most corpora, are annotated texts and lexicons. Texts have a temporal structure, whereas lexicons have a record structure.   \n• The life cycle of a corpus includes data collection, annotation, quality control, and publication. The life cycle continues after publication as the corpus is modified and enriched during the course of research.   \n• Corpus development involves a balance between capturing a representative sample of language usage, and capturing enough material from any one source or genre to be useful; multiplying out the dimensions of variability is usually not feasible because of resource limitations.   \n• XML provides a useful format for the storage and interchange of linguistic data, but provides no shortcuts for solving pervasive data modeling problems.   \n• Toolbox format is widely used in language documentation projects; we can write programs to support the curation of Toolbox files, and to convert them to XML.

We’ve explored many of these in the preceding chapters, including tokenization, tagging, classification, information extraction, and building syntactic and semantic representations. You should now be equipped to work with large datasets, to create robust models of linguistic phenomena, and to extend them into components for practical language technologies. We hope that the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) has served to open up the exciting endeavor of practical natural language processing to a broader audience than before. \nIn spite of all that has come before, language presents us with far more than a temporary challenge for computation. Consider the following sentences which attest to the riches of language: \n1. Overhead the day drives level and grey, hiding the sun by a flight of grey spears. (William Faulkner, As I Lay Dying, 1935)   \n2. When using the toaster please ensure that the exhaust fan is turned on. (sign in dormitory kitchen)   \n3. Amiodarone weakly inhibited CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4-mediated activities with Ki values of $4 5 . 1 substack { - 2 7 1 . 6 mu mathrm { M } }$ (Medline, PMID: 10718780)   \n4. Iraqi Head Seeks Arms (spoof news headline)   \n5. The earnest prayer of a righteous man has great power and wonderful results. (James 5:16b)   \n6. Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe (Lewis Carroll, Jabberwocky, 1872)   \n7. There are two ways to do this, AFAIK :smile: (Internet discussion archive) \nOther evidence for the riches of language is the vast array of disciplines whose work centers on language. Some obvious disciplines include translation, literary criticism, philosophy, anthropology, and psychology. Many less obvious disciplines investigate language use, including law, hermeneutics, forensics, telephony, pedagogy, archaeology, cryptanalysis, and speech pathology. Each applies distinct methodologies to gather observations, develop theories, and test hypotheses. All serve to deepen our understanding of language and of the intellect that is manifested in language.",

        "content": "In view of the complexity of language and the broad range of interest in studying it from different angles, it’s clear that we have barely scratched the surface here. Additionally, within NLP itself, there are many important methods and applications that we haven’t mentioned. \nIn our closing remarks we will take a broader view of NLP, including its foundations and the further directions you might want to explore. Some of the topics are not well supported by NLTK, and you might like to rectify that problem by contributing new software and data to the toolkit. \nLanguage Processing Versus Symbol Processing \nThe very notion that natural language could be treated in a computational manner grew out of a research program, dating back to the early 1900s, to reconstruct mathematical reasoning using logic, most clearly manifested in work by Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Tarski, Lambek, and Carnap. This work led to the notion of language as a formal system amenable to automatic processing. Three later developments laid the foundation for natural language processing. The first was formal language theory. This defined a language as a set of strings accepted by a class of automata, such as context-free languages and pushdown automata, and provided the underpinnings for computational syntax. \nThe second development was symbolic logic. This provided a formal method for capturing selected aspects of natural language that are relevant for expressing logical proofs. A formal calculus in symbolic logic provides the syntax of a language, together with rules of inference and, possibly, rules of interpretation in a set-theoretic model; examples are propositional logic and first-order logic. Given such a calculus, with a well-defined syntax and semantics, it becomes possible to associate meanings with expressions of natural language by translating them into expressions of the formal calculus. For example, if we translate John saw Mary into a formula $s a w ( j , m )$ , we (implicitly or explicitly) interpret the English verb saw as a binary relation, and John and Mary as denoting individuals. More general statements like All birds fly require quantifiers, in this case $forall$ , meaning for all: $forall x ( b i r d ( x )  f l y ( x ) )$ . This use of logic provided the technical machinery to perform inferences that are an important part of language understanding. \nA closely related development was the principle of compositionality, namely that the meaning of a complex expression is composed from the meaning of its parts and their mode of combination (Chapter 10). This principle provided a useful correspondence between syntax and semantics, namely that the meaning of a complex expression could be computed recursively. Consider the sentence It is not true that $p$ , where $p$ is a proposition. We can represent the meaning of this sentence as $n o t ( p )$ . \nSimilarly, we can represent the meaning of John saw Mary as $s a w ( j , m )$ . Now we can compute the interpretation of $I t$ is not true that John saw Mary recursively, using the foregoing information, to get $boldsymbol { eta } o t ( s a w ( j , m ) )$ . \nThe approaches just outlined share the premise that computing with natural language crucially relies on rules for manipulating symbolic representations. For a certain period in the development of NLP, particularly during the 1980s, this premise provided a common starting point for both linguists and practitioners of NLP, leading to a family of grammar formalisms known as unification-based (or feature-based) grammar (see Chapter 9), and to NLP applications implemented in the Prolog programming language. Although grammar-based NLP is still a significant area of research, it has become somewhat eclipsed in the last 15–20 years due to a variety of factors. One significant influence came from automatic speech recognition. Although early work in speech processing adopted a model that emulated the kind of rule-based phonological phonology processing typified by the Sound Pattern of English (Chomsky & Halle, 1968), this turned out to be hopelessly inadequate in dealing with the hard problem of recognizing actual speech in anything like real time. By contrast, systems which involved learning patterns from large bodies of speech data were significantly more accurate, efficient, and robust. In addition, the speech community found that progress in building better systems was hugely assisted by the construction of shared resources for quantitatively measuring performance against common test data. Eventually, much of the NLP community embraced a data-intensive orientation to language processing, coupled with a growing use of machine-learning techniques and evaluation-led methodology. \nContemporary Philosophical Divides \nThe contrasting approaches to NLP described in the preceding section relate back to early metaphysical debates about rationalism versus empiricism and realism versus idealism that occurred in the Enlightenment period of Western philosophy. These debates took place against a backdrop of orthodox thinking in which the source of all knowledge was believed to be divine revelation. During this period of the 17th and 18th centuries, philosophers argued that human reason or sensory experience has priority over revelation. Descartes and Leibniz, among others, took the rationalist position, asserting that all truth has its origins in human thought, and in the existence of “innate ideas” implanted in our minds from birth. For example, they argued that the principles of Euclidean geometry were developed using human reason, and were not the result of supernatural revelation or sensory experience. In contrast, Locke and others took the empiricist view, that our primary source of knowledge is the experience of our faculties, and that human reason plays a secondary role in reflecting on that experience. Oftencited evidence for this position was Galileo’s discovery—based on careful observation of the motion of the planets—that the solar system is heliocentric and not geocentric. In the context of linguistics, this debate leads to the following question: to what extent does human linguistic experience, versus our innate “language faculty,” provide the basis for our knowledge of language? In NLP this issue surfaces in debates about the priority of corpus data versus linguistic introspection in the construction of computational models.",

Kant argued for a distinction between phenomena, the manifestations we can experience, and “things in themselves” which can never been known directly. A linguistic realist would take a theoretical construct like noun phrase to be a real-world entity that exists independently of human perception and reason, and which actually causes the observed linguistic phenomena. A linguistic idealist, on the other hand, would argue that noun phrases, along with more abstract constructs, like semantic representations, are intrinsically unobservable, and simply play the role of useful fictions. The way linguists write about theories often betrays a realist position, whereas NLP practitioners occupy neutral territory or else lean toward the idealist position. Thus, in NLP, it is often enough if a theoretical abstraction leads to a useful result; it does not matter whether this result sheds any light on human linguistic processing. \nThese issues are still alive today, and show up in the distinctions between symbolic versus statistical methods, deep versus shallow processing, binary versus gradient classifications, and scientific versus engineering goals. However, such contrasts are now highly nuanced, and the debate is no longer as polarized as it once was. In fact, most of the discussions—and most of the advances, even—involve a “balancing act.” For example, one intermediate position is to assume that humans are innately endowed with analogical and memory-based learning methods (weak rationalism), and use these methods to identify meaningful patterns in their sensory language experience (empiricism). \nWe have seen many examples of this methodology throughout this book. Statistical methods inform symbolic models anytime corpus statistics guide the selection of productions in a context-free grammar, i.e., “grammar engineering.” Symbolic methods inform statistical models anytime a corpus that was created using rule-based methods is used as a source of features for training a statistical language model, i.e., “grammatical inference.” The circle is closed. \nNLTK Roadmap \nThe Natural Language Toolkit is a work in progress, and is being continually expanded as people contribute code. Some areas of NLP and linguistics are not (yet) well supported in NLTK, and contributions in these areas are especially welcome.

Some areas of NLP and linguistics are not (yet) well supported in NLTK, and contributions in these areas are especially welcome. Check http: //www.nltk.org/ for news about developments after the publication date of this book. Contributions in the following areas are particularly encouraged: \nPhonology and morphology \nComputational approaches to the study of sound patterns and word structures typically use a finite-state toolkit. Phenomena such as suppletion and non-concatenative morphology are difficult to address using the string-processing methods we have been studying. The technical challenge is not only to link NLTK to a highperformance finite-state toolkit, but to avoid duplication of lexical data and to link the morphosyntactic features needed by morph analyzers and syntactic parsers. \nHigh-performance components \nSome NLP tasks are too computationally intensive for pure Python implementations to be feasible. However, in some cases the expense arises only when training models, not when using them to label inputs. NLTK’s package system provides a convenient way to distribute trained models, even models trained using corpora that cannot be freely distributed. Alternatives are to develop Python interfaces to high-performance machine learning tools, or to expand the reach of Python by using parallel programming techniques such as MapReduce. \nLexical semantics \nThis is a vibrant area of current research, encompassing inheritance models of the lexicon, ontologies, multiword expressions, etc., mostly outside the scope of NLTK as it stands. A conservative goal would be to access lexical information from rich external stores in support of tasks in word sense disambiguation, parsing, and semantic interpretation. \nNatural language generation \nProducing coherent text from underlying representations of meaning is an important part of NLP; a unification-based approach to NLG has been developed in NLTK, and there is scope for more contributions in this area. \nLinguistic fieldwork \nA major challenge faced by linguists is to document thousands of endangered languages, work which generates heterogeneous and rapidly evolving data in large quantities. More fieldwork data formats, including interlinear text formats and lexicon interchange formats, could be supported in NLTK, helping linguists to curate and analyze this data, while liberating them to spend as much time as possible on data elicitation. \nOther languages \nImproved support for NLP in languages other than English could involve work in two areas: obtaining permission to distribute more corpora with NLTK’s data collection; and writing language-specific HOWTOs for posting at http://www.nltk .org/howto, illustrating the use of NLTK and discussing language-specific problems for NLP, including character encodings, word segmentation, and morphology. NLP researchers with expertise in a particular language could arrange to translate this book and host a copy on the NLTK website; this would go beyond translating the discussions to providing equivalent worked examples using data in the target language, a non-trivial undertaking. \nNLTK-Contrib \nMany of NLTK’s core components were contributed by members of the NLP community, and were initially housed in NLTK’s “Contrib” package, nltk_contrib. The only requirement for software to be added to this package is that it must be written in Python, relevant to NLP, and given the same open source license as the rest of NLTK. Imperfect software is welcome, and will probably be improved over time by other members of the NLP community. \nTeaching materials \nSince the earliest days of NLTK development, teaching materials have accompanied the software, materials that have gradually expanded to fill this book, plus a substantial quantity of online materials as well. We hope that instructors who supplement these materials with presentation slides, problem sets, solution sets, and more detailed treatments of the topics we have covered will make them available, and will notify the authors so we can link them from http://www.nltk.org/. Of particular value are materials that help NLP become a mainstream course in the undergraduate programs of computer science and linguistics departments, or that make NLP accessible at the secondary level, where there is significant scope for including computational content in the language, literature, computer science, and information technology curricula. \nOnly a toolkit \nAs stated in the preface, NLTK is a toolkit, not a system. Many problems will be tackled with a combination of NLTK, Python, other Python libraries, and interfaces to external NLP tools and formats. \nEnvoi... \nLinguists are sometimes asked how many languages they speak, and have to explain that this field actually concerns the study of abstract structures that are shared by languages, a study which is more profound and elusive than learning to speak as many languages as possible. Similarly, computer scientists are sometimes asked how many programming languages they know, and have to explain that computer science actually concerns the study of data structures and algorithms that can be implemented in any programming language, a study which is more profound and elusive than striving for fluency in as many programming languages as possible. \nThis book has covered many topics in the field of Natural Language Processing. Most of the examples have used Python and English. However, it would be unfortunate if readers concluded that NLP is about how to write Python programs to manipulate English text, or more broadly, about how to write programs (in any programming language) to manipulate text (in any natural language). Our selection of Python and English was expedient, nothing more. Even our focus on programming itself was only a means to an end: as a way to understand data structures and algorithms for representing and manipulating collections of linguistically annotated text, as a way to build new language technologies to better serve the needs of the information society, and ultimately as a pathway into deeper understanding of the vast riches of human language. \nBut for the present: happy hacking!",
