For example, here is an algorithm for singing that annoying song “99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall”, for arbitrary values of 99: \nBottlesOfBeer(n): For $i gets n$ down to 1 Sing “i bottles of beer on the wall, i bottles of beer,” Sing “Take one down, pass it around, i 1 bottles of beer on the wall.” Sing “No bottles of beer on the wall, no bottles of beer,” Sing “Go to the store, buy some more, n bottles of beer on the wall.” \nThe word “algorithm” does not derive, as algorithmophobic classicists might guess, from the Greek roots arithmos $( dot { mathrm { { a } } } varrho mathfrak { l } theta mathfrak { { }  mathfrak { l } dot { mathrm { { o } } } varsigma )$ , meaning “number”, and algos (ἄλγος), meaning “pain”. Rather, it is a corruption of the name of the 9th century Persian scholar Muh. ammad ibn Mu¯sa¯ al-Khwa¯rizmı¯.1 Al-Khwa¯rizmı¯ is perhaps best known as the writer of the treatise Al-Kit¯ab al-mukhta.sar f¯ıh¯ıs¯ab al-ğabr wa’l-muq¯abala,2 from which the modern word algebra derives. In a different treatise, al-Khw¯arizm¯ı described the modern decimal system for writing and manipulating numbers—in particular, the use of a small circle or .sifr to represent a missing quantity—which had been developed in India several centuries earlier. The methods described in this latter treatise, using either written figures or counting stones, became known in English as algorism or augrym, and its figures became known in English as ciphers. \n\nAlthough both place-value notation and al-Khwa¯rizmı¯’s works were already known by some European scholars, the “Hindu-Arabic” numeric system was popularized in Europe by the medieval Italian mathematician and tradesman Leonardo of Pisa, better known as Fibonacci. Thanks in part to his 1202 book Liber Abaci,3 written figures began to replace the counting table (then known as an abacus) and finger arithmetic4 as the preferred platform for calculation5 in Europe in the 13th century—not because written decimal figures were easier to learn or use, but because they provided an audit trail. Ciphers became common in Western Europe only with the advent of movable type, and truly ubiquitous only after cheap paper became plentiful in the early 19th century. \nEventually the word algorism evolved into the modern algorithm, via folk etymology from the Greek arithmos (and perhaps the previously mentioned algos).6 Thus, until very recently, the word algorithm referred exclusively \n4\f Reckoning with digits! \n5The word calculate derives from the Latin word calculus, meaning “small rock”, referring to the stones on a counting table, or as Chaucer called them, augrym stones. In 440bce, Herodotus wrote in his Histories that “The Greeks write and calculate (λογίζεσθαι ψήφοις, literally ‘reckon with pebbles’) from left to right; the Egyptians do the opposite. Yet they say that their way of writing is toward the right, and the Greek way toward the left.” (Herodotus is strangely silent on which end of the egg the Egyptians ate first.) \n6Some medieval sources claim that the Greek prefix “algo-” means “art” or “introduction”. Others claim that algorithms were invented by a Greek philosopher, or a king of India, or perhaps a king of Spain, named “Algus” or “Algor” or “Argus”. A few, possibly including Dante Alighieri, even identified the inventor with the mythological Greek shipbuilder and eponymous argonaut. It’s unclear whether any of these risible claims were intended to be historically accurate, or merely mnemonic. \nto mechanical techniques for place-value arithmetic using “Arabic” numerals. People trained in the fast and reliable execution of these procedures were called algorists or computators, or more simply, computers. \n0.2 Multiplication \nAlthough they have been a topic of formal academic study for only a few decades, algorithms have been with us since the dawn of civilization. Descriptions of step-by-step arithmetic computation are among the earliest examples of written human language, long predating the expositions by Fibonacci and al-Khwa¯rizmı¯, or even the place-value notation they popularized. \nLattice Multiplication \nThe most familiar method for multiplying large numbers, at least for American students, is the lattice algorithm.

To simplify notation,9 the input consists of a pair of arrays $X [ 0 ldots m - 1 ]$ and $Y [ 0 ldots n - 1 ]$ , representing the numbers \n\nand similarly, the output consists of a single array $Z [ 0 ldots m + n - 1 ]$ , representing the product \nThe algorithm uses addition and single-digit multiplication as primitive operations. Addition can be performed using a simple for-loop. In practice, single-digit multiplication is performed using a lookup table, either carved into clay tablets, painted on strips of wood or bamboo, written on paper, stored in read-only memory, or memorized by the computator. The entire lattice algorithm can be summarized by the formula \nDifferent variants of the lattice algorithm evaluate the partial products $X [ i ]$ · $Y [ j ] cdot 1 0 ^ { i + j }$ in different orders and use different strategies for computing their sum. For example, in Liber Abaco, Fibonacci describes a variant that considers the mn partial products in increasing order of significance, as shown in modern pseudocode below. \nFibonacci’s algorithm is often executed by storing all the partial products in a two-dimensional table (often called a “tableau” or “grate” or “lattice”) and then summing along the diagonals with appropriate carries, as shown on the right in Figure 0.1. American elementary-school students are taught to multiply one factor (the “multiplicand”) by each digit in the other factor (the “multiplier”), writing down all the multiplicand-by-digit products before adding them up, as shown on the left in Figure 0.1. This was also the method described by Eutocius, although he fittingly considered the multiplier digits from left to right, as shown in Figure 0.2. Both of these variants (and several others) are described and illustrated side by side in the anonymous 1458 textbook L’Arte dell’Abbaco, also known as the Treviso Arithmetic, the first printed mathematics book in the West. \n\n11724 X1172 1000000 xooβ'n\" 100000   \nErix0opn 72125 ei5 100000 MMMβoxe' 172121 lα 77000 MMgotβw\" 4900 Ms,dmeun'\"8\" 5 14844 Booudo\" 2200   \nQxe'tβl\"n'k\"d'8'gd\" 144 125   \nouov Myoog8 12 summa 1373877 \nAll of these variants of the lattice algorithm—and other similar variants described by Sunzi, al-Khwa¯rizmı¯, Fibonacci, L’Arte dell’Abbaco, and many other sources—compute the product of any $m$ -digit number and any $n$ -digit number in $O ( m n )$ time; the running time of every variant is dominated by the number of single-digit multiplications. \nDuplation and Mediation \nThe lattice algorithm is not the oldest multiplication algorithm for which we have direct recorded evidence.

Don’t let the iterative pseudocode fool you; the algorithm is fundamentally recursive! \nAs stated, PeasantMultiply performs $O ( log x )$ parity, addition, and mediation operations, but we can improve this bound to $O ( log operatorname* { m i n } { x , y } )$ by swapping the two arguments when $x > y$ . Assuming the numbers are represented using any reasonable place-value notation (like binary, decimal, Babylonian hexagesimal, Egyptian duodecimal, Roman numeral, Chinese counting rods, bead positions on an abacus, and so on), each operation requires at most $O ( log ( x y ) ) = O ( log operatorname* { m a x } { x , y } )$ single-digit operations, so the overall running time of the algorithm is $O ( log operatorname* { m i n } { x , y } cdot log operatorname* { m a x } { x , y } ) = O ( log x cdot log y )$ . \nIn other words, this algorithm requires $O ( m n )$ time to multiply an $m$ -digit number by an $n$ -digit number; up to constant factors, this is the same running time as the lattice algorithm. This algorithm requires (a constant factor!) more paperwork to execute by hand than the lattice algorithm, but the necessary primitive operations are arguably easier for humans to perform. In fact, the two algorithms are equivalent when numbers are represented in binary. \nCompass and Straightedge \nClassical Greek geometers identified numbers (or more accurately, magnitudes) with line segments of the appropriate length, which they manipulated using two simple mechanical tools—the compass and the straightedge—versions of which had already been in common use by surveyors, architects, and other artisans for centuries. Using only these two tools, these scholars reduced several complex geometric constructions to the following primitive operations, starting with one or more identified reference points. \n• Draw the unique line passing through two distinct identified points.   \n• Draw the unique circle centered at one identified point and passing through another.   \n• Identify the intersection point (if any) of two lines.   \n• Identify the intersection points (if any) of a line and a circle.   \n• Identify the intersection points (if any) of two circles. \nIn practice, Greek geometry students almost certainly drew their constructions on an abax $( overrightarrow { a } vert 3 overrightarrow { a } dot { xi } )$ , a table covered in dust or sand.11 Centuries earlier, Egyptian surveyors carried out many of the same constructions using ropes to determine straight lines and circles on the ground.12 However, Euclid and other Greek geometers presented compass and straightedge constructions as precise mathematical abstractions—points are ideal points; lines are ideal lines; and circles are ideal circles. \nFigure 0.4 shows an algorithm, described in Euclid’s Elements about 2500 years ago, for multiplying or dividing two magnitudes.

First, in a preprocessing stage, each state is allocated one representative. Then in each iteration of the main loop, the next representative is assigned to the state with the highest priority. The priority of each state is defined to be $P / { sqrt { r ( r + 1 ) } }$ , where $P$ is the state’s population and $r$ is the number of representatives already allocated to that state. \nThe algorithm is described in pseudocode in Figure 0.5. The input consists of an array $P o p [ 1 ldots n ]$ storing the populations of the $n$ states and an integer $R$ equal to the total number of representatives; the algorithm assumes $R geq n$ . (Currently, in the United States, $n = 5 0$ and $R = 4 3 5 .$ ) The output array $R e p [ 1 ldots n ]$ records the number of representatives allocated to each state. \nApportionCongress(Pop[1 .. n], R): PQ NewPriorityQueue Give every state its first representative for $s gets 1$ to $n$ $begin{array} { l } { R e p [ s ] gets 1 }  { operatorname { I N S E R T } left( P Q , s , P o p [ i ] / sqrt { 2 } right) } end{array}$ Allocate the remaining $n { - } R$ representatives for $i gets 1$ to $n { - } R$ $s gets mathrm { E x T R A C T M A X } ( P Q )$ $R e p [ s ] gets R e p [ s ] + 1$ priorit $left. gamma left.

(The actual law doesn’t say anything about priority queues, of course.) The output of the algorithm, and therefore its correctness, does not depend at all on how this priority queue is implemented. The Census Bureau uses a sorted array, stored in a single column of an Excel spreadsheet, which is recalculated from scratch at every iteration. You (should have) learned a more efficient implementation in your undergraduate data structures class. \n\nSimilar apportionment algorithms are used in multi-party parliamentary elections around the world, where the number of seats allocated to each party is supposed to be proportional to the number of votes that party receives. The two most common are the $D$ ’Hondt method14 and the Webster–Sainte-Laguë method,15 which respectively use priorities $P / ( r + 1 )$ and $P / ( 2 r + 1 )$ in place of the square-root expression in Huntington-Hill.

We’ll see reductions over and over again in this book. As hundreds of businessmen and politicians have demonstrated, if you know how to solve the easier problem, a reduction tells you how to solve the harder one. \nMartin’s algorithm, like some of our previous examples, is not the kind of algorithm that computer scientists are used to thinking about, because it is phrased in terms of operations that are difficult for computers to perform. This book focuses (almost!) exclusively on algorithms that can be reasonably implemented on a standard digital computer. Each step in these algorithms is either directly supported by common programming languages (such as arithmetic, assignments, loops, or recursion) or something that you’ve already learned how to do (like sorting, binary search, tree traversal, or singing $^ { * } n$ Bottles of Beer on the Wall”). \n0.5 Describing Algorithms \nThe skills required to effectively design and analyze algorithms are entangled with the skills required to effectively describe algorithms. At least in my classes, a complete description of any algorithm has four components: \n• What: A precise specification of the problem that the algorithm solves.   \n• How: A precise description of the algorithm itself.   \n• Why: A proof that the algorithm solves the problem it is supposed to solve.   \n• How fast: An analysis of the running time of the algorithm. \nIt is not necessary (or even advisable) to develop these four components in this particular order. Problem specifications, algorithm descriptions, correctness proofs, and time analyses usually evolve simultaneously, with the development of each component informing the development of the others. For example, we may need to tweak the problem description to support a faster algorithm, or modify the algorithm to handle a tricky case in the proof of correctness. Nevertheless, presenting these components separately is usually clearest for the reader. \nAs with any writing, it’s important to aim your descriptions at the right audience; I recommend writing for a competent but skeptical programmer who is not as clever as you are. Think of yourself six months ago. As you develop any new algorithm, you will naturally build up lots of intuition about the problem and about how your algorithm solves it, and your informal reasoning will be guided by that intuition. But anyone reading your algorithm later, or the code you derive from it, won’t share your intuition or experience. Neither will your compiler. Neither will you six months from now. All they will have is your written description. \nEven if you never have to explain your algorithms to anyone else, it’s still important to develop them with an audience in mind. Trying to communicate clearly forces you to think more clearly. In particular, writing for a novice audience, who will interpret your words exactly as written, forces you to work through fine details, no matter how “obvious” or “intuitive” your high-level ideas may seem at the moment. Similarly, writing for a skeptical audience forces you to develop robust arguments for correctness and efficiency, instead of trusting your intuition or your intelligence.18",

        "content": "I cannot emphasize this point enough: Your primary job as an algorithm designer is teaching other people how and why your algorithms work. If you can’t communicate your ideas to other human beings, they may as well not exist. Producing correct and efficient executable code is an important but secondary goal. Convincing yourself, your professors, your (prospective) employers, your colleagues, or your students that you are smart is at best a distant third. \nSpecifying the Problem \nBefore we can even start developing a new algorithm, we have to agree on what problem our algorithm is supposed to solve. Similarly, before we can even start describing an algorithm, we have to describe the problem that the algorithm is supposed to solve. \nAlgorithmic problems are often presented using standard English, in terms of real-world objects. It’s up to us, the algorithm designers, to restate these problems in terms of formal, abstract, mathematical objects—numbers, arrays, lists, graphs, trees, and so on—that we can reason about formally. We must also determine if the problem statement carries any hidden assumptions, and state those assumptions explicitly. (For example, in the song $^ { * } n$ Bottles of Beer on the Wall”, $n$ is always a non-negative integer.19) \nWe may need to refine our specification as we develop the algorithm. For example, our algorithm may require a particular input representation, or produce a particular output representation, that was left unspecified in the original informal problem description. Or our algorithm might actually solve a more general problem than we were originally asked to solve. (This is a common feature of recursive algorithms.) \nThe specification should include just enough detail that someone else could use our algorithm as a black box, without knowing how or why the algorithm actually works. In particular, we must describe the type and meaning of each input parameter, and exactly how the eventual output depends on the input parameters. On the other hand, our specification should deliberately hide any details that are not necessary to use the algorithm as a black box. Let that which does not matter truly slide. \nFor example, the lattice and duplation-and-mediation algorithms both solve the same problem: Given two non-negative integers $x$ and $y$ , each represented as an array of digits, compute the product $x cdot y$ , also represented as an array of digits. To someone using these algorithms, the choice of algorithm is completely irrelevant. On the other hand, the Greek straightedge-and-compass algorithm solves a different problem, because the input and output values are represented by line segments instead of arrays of digits. \nDescribing the Algorithm \nComputer programs are concrete representations of algorithms, but algorithms are not programs. Rather, algorithms are abstract mechanical procedures that can be implemented in any programming language that supports the underlying primitive operations. The idiosyncratic syntactic details of your favorite programming language are utterly irrelevant; focusing on these will only distract you (and your readers) from what’s really going on.20 A good algorithm description is closer to what we should write in the comments of a real program than the code itself. Code is a poor medium for storytelling. \nOn the other hand, a plain English prose description is usually not a good idea either. Algorithms have lots of idiomatic structure—especially conditionals, loops, function calls, and recursion—that are far too easily hidden by unstructured prose. Colloquial English is full of ambiguities and shades of meaning, but algorithms must be described as unambiguously as possible. Prose is a poor medium for precision. \nIn my opinion, the clearest way to present an algorithm is using a combination of pseudocode and structured English. Pseudocode uses the structure of formal programming languages and mathematics to break algorithms into primitive steps; the primitive steps themselves can be written using mathematical notation, pure English, or an appropriate mixture of the two, whatever is clearest. Wellwritten pseudocode reveals the internal structure of the algorithm but hides irrelevant implementation details, making the algorithm easier to understand, analyze, debug, and implement.",

For more examples, consult your favorite preschooler. \nA few songs have even more bizarre singing times. A fairly modern example is “The TELNET Song” by Guy Steele, which actually takes $Theta ( 2 ^ { n } )$ time to sing the first $n$ verses; Steele recommended $n = 4$ . Finally, there are some songs that never end.23 \nExcept for “The TELNET Song”, all of these songs are most naturally expressed as a small set of nested loops, so their running singing times can be computed using nested summations. The running time of a recursive algorithm is more easily expressed as a recurrence. For example, the peasant multiplication algorithm can be expressed recursively as follows: \nLet $T ( x , y )$ denote the number of parity, addition, and mediation operations required to compute $x cdot y$ . This function satisfies the recursive inequality $T ( x , y ) leq T ( lfloor x / 2 rfloor , 2 y ) + 2$ with base case $T ( 0 , y ) = 0$ . Techniques described in the next chapter imply the upper bound $T ( x , y ) = O ( log x )$ . \nSometimes the running time of an algorithm depends on a particular implementation of some underlying data structure of subroutine. For example, the Huntington-Hill apportionment algorithm ApportionCongress runs in $O ( N + R I + ( R - n ) E )$ time, where $N$ denotes the running time of NewPriorityQueue, $I$ denotes the running time of Insert, and $E$ denotes the running time of ExtractMax. Under the reasonable assumption that $R geq 2 n$ (on average, each state gets at least two representatives), we can simplify this bound to $O ( N + R ( I + E ) )$ . The precise running time depends on the implementation of the underlying priority queue. The Census Bureau implements the priority queue as an unsorted array, which gives us $N = I = Theta ( 1 )$ and $E = Theta ( n )$ , so the Census Bureau’s implementation of ApportionCongress runs in $O ( R n )$ time. However, if we implement the priority queue as a binary heap or a heap-ordered array, we have $N = Theta ( 1 )$ and $I = E = O ( log n )$ , so the overall algorithm runs in $O ( R log { n } )$ time. \n\nFinally, sometimes we are interested in computational resources other than time, such as space, number of coin flips, number of cache or page faults, number of inter-process messages, or the number of gifts my true love gave to me. These resources can be analyzed using the same techniques used to analyze running time. For example, lattice multiplication of two $n$ -digit numbers requires $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ space if we write down all the partial products before adding them, but only $O ( n )$ space if we add them on the fly. \nExercises \n0. Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm that determines, given a legal arrangement of standard pieces on a standard chess board, which player will win at chess from the given starting position if both players play perfectly.

(b) Identify (or write) a song that requires $Theta ( n log n )$ time to sing the first n verses. (c) Identify (or write) a song that requires some other weird amount of time to sing the first n verses. \n2. Careful readers might complain that our analysis of songs like $^ { * } n$ Bottles of Beer on the Wall” or “The n Days of Christmas” is overly simplistic, because larger numbers take longer to sing than shorter numbers. More generally, because there are only so many words of a given length, larger sets of words necessarily contain longer words.24 We can more accurately estimate singing time by counting the number of syllables sung, rather than the number of words. \n(a) How long does it take to sing the integer n?",

The cumulative drinking song “The Barley Mow” has been sung throughout the British Isles for centuries. The song has many variants; Figure 0.6 contains pseudolyrics for one version traditionally sung in Devon and Cornwall, where vessel[i] is the name of a vessel that holds $2 ^ { i }$ ounces of beer.25 \nBarleyMow(n): “Here’s a health to the barley-mow, my brave boys,” “Here’s a health to the barley-mow!” “We’ll drink it out of the jolly brown bowl,” “Here’s a health to the barley-mow!” “Here’s a health to the barley-mow, my brave boys,” “Here’s a health to the barley-mow!” for $i gets 1$ to n “We’ll drink it out of the vessel[i], boys,” “Here’s a health to the barley-mow!” for $j gets i$ downto 1 “The vessel[ j],” “And the jolly brown bowl!” “Here’s a health to the barley-mow!” “Here’s a health to the barley-mow, my brave boys,” “Here’s a health to the barley-mow!” \n(a) Suppose each name vessel[i] is a single word, and you can sing four words a second. How long would it take you to sing BarleyMow $( n ) ?$ (Give a tight asymptotic bound.)   \n(b) If you want to sing this song for arbitrarily large values of $n$ , you’ll have to make up your own vessel names. To avoid repetition, these names must become progressively longer as $n$ increases. Suppose vessel $[ n ]$ has \n$Theta ( log n )$ syllables, and you can sing six syllables per second. Now how long would it take you to sing BarleyMow $( n ) ?$ (Give a tight asymptotic bound.) \n(c) Suppose each time you mention the name of a vessel, you actually drink the corresponding amount of beer: one ounce for the jolly brown bowl, and $2 ^ { i }$ ounces for each vessel[i]. Assuming for purposes of this problem that you are at least 21 years old, exactly how many ounces of beer would you drink if you sang BarleyMow(n)? (Give an exact answer, not just an asymptotic bound.) \n4. Recall that the input to the Huntington-Hill algorithm ApportionCongress is an array $P o p [ 1 ldots n ]$ , where $P o p [ i ]$ is the population of the ith state, and an integer $R$ , the total number of representatives to be allotted. The output is an array $R e p [ 1 ldots n ]$ , where $R e p [ i ]$ is the number of representatives allotted to the ith state by the algorithm. \nThe Huntington-Hill algorithm is sometimes described in a way that avoids the use of priority queues entirely. The top-level algorithm “guesses” a positive real number $D$ , called the divisor, and then runs the following subroutine to compute an apportionment. The variable $q$ is the ideal quota of representatives allocated to a state for the given divisor $D$ ; the actual number of representatives allocated is always either $lceil q rceil$ or $lfloor q rfloor$ . \nThere are three possibilities for the final return value reps. If $r e p s < R$ , we did not allocate enough representatives, which (at least intuitively) means our divisor $D$ was too small. If $r e p s > R$ , we allocated too many representatives, which (at least intuitively) means our divisor $D$ was too large. Finally, if $r e p s = R$ , we can return the array $R e p [ 1 ldots n ]$ as the final apportionment. In practice, we can compute a valid apportionment (with $r e p s = R )$ ) by calling HHGuess with a small number of integer divisors close to the standard divisor $D = P / R$ . \nIn the following problems, let $begin{array} { r } { P = sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } P o p [ i ] } end{array}$ denote the total population of all $n$ states, and assume that $n leq R leq P$ . \n(a) Show that calling HHGuess with the standard divisor $D = P / R$ does not necessarily yield a valid apportionment.   \n(b) Prove that if HHGuess returns the same value of reps for two different divisors $D$ and $D ^ { prime }$ , it also computes the same allocation $R e p [ 1 ldots n ]$ for both of those divisors.   \n(c) Prove that if HHGuess returns the correct value $R$ , it computes the same allocation $R e p [ 1 . . n ]$ as our earlier algorithm ApportionCongress.   \n(d) Prove that a “correct” divisor $D$ does not necessarily exist! That is, describe inputs $P o p [ 1 ldots n ]$ and $R$ , where $n leq R leq P$ , such that for every real number $D > 0$ , the number of representatives allocated by HHGuess is not equal to $R$ .

Reducing one problem $X$ to another problem $Y$ means to write an algorithm for $X$ that uses an algorithm for $Y$ as a black box or subroutine. Crucially, the correctness of the resulting algorithm for $X$ cannot depend in any way on how the algorithm for $Y$ works. The only thing we can assume is that the black box solves $Y$ correctly. The inner workings of the black box are simply none of our business; they’re somebody else’s problem. It’s often best to literally think of the black box as functioning purely by magic. \nFor example, the peasant multiplication algorithm described in the previous chapter reduces the problem of multiplying two arbitrary positive integers to three simpler problems: addition, mediation (halving), and parity-checking. The algorithm relies on an abstract “positive integer” data type that supports those three operations, but the correctness of the multiplication algorithm does not depend on the precise data representation (tally marks, clay tokens, Babylonian hexagesimal, quipu, counting rods, Roman numerals, finger positions, augrym stones, gobar numerals, binary, negabinary, Gray code, balanced ternary, phinary, quater-imaginary, . . . ), or on the precise implementations of those operations. Of course, the running time of the multiplication algorithm depends on the running time of the addition, mediation, and parity operations, but that’s a separate issue from correctness. Most importantly, we can create a more efficient multiplication algorithm just by switching to a more efficient number representation (from tally marks to place-value notation, for example).",

Reducing one problem $X$ to another problem $Y$ means to write an algorithm for $X$ that uses an algorithm for $Y$ as a black box or subroutine. Crucially, the correctness of the resulting algorithm for $X$ cannot depend in any way on how the algorithm for $Y$ works. The only thing we can assume is that the black box solves $Y$ correctly. The inner workings of the black box are simply none of our business; they’re somebody else’s problem. It’s often best to literally think of the black box as functioning purely by magic. \nFor example, the peasant multiplication algorithm described in the previous chapter reduces the problem of multiplying two arbitrary positive integers to three simpler problems: addition, mediation (halving), and parity-checking. The algorithm relies on an abstract “positive integer” data type that supports those three operations, but the correctness of the multiplication algorithm does not depend on the precise data representation (tally marks, clay tokens, Babylonian hexagesimal, quipu, counting rods, Roman numerals, finger positions, augrym stones, gobar numerals, binary, negabinary, Gray code, balanced ternary, phinary, quater-imaginary, . . . ), or on the precise implementations of those operations. Of course, the running time of the multiplication algorithm depends on the running time of the addition, mediation, and parity operations, but that’s a separate issue from correctness. Most importantly, we can create a more efficient multiplication algorithm just by switching to a more efficient number representation (from tally marks to place-value notation, for example). \n\nSimilarly, the Huntington-Hill algorithm reduces the problem of apportioning Congress to the problem of maintaining a priority queue that supports the operations Insert and ExtractMax. The abstract data type “priority queue” is a black box; the correctness of the apportionment algorithm does not depend on any specific priority queue data structure. Of course, the running time of the apportionment algorithm depends on the running time of the Insert and ExtractMax algorithms, but that’s a separate issue from the correctness of the algorithm. The beauty of the reduction is that we can create a more efficient apportionment algorithm by simply swapping in a new priority queue data structure. Moreover, the designer of that data structure does not need to know or care that it will be used to apportion Congress. \nWhen we design algorithms, we may not know exactly how the basic building blocks we use are implemented, or how our algorithms might be used as building blocks to solve even bigger problems. That ignorance is uncomfortable for many beginners, but it is both unavoidable and extremely useful. Even when you do know precisely how your components work, it is often extremely helpful to pretend that you don’t. \n1.2 Simplify and Delegate \nRecursion is a particularly powerful kind of reduction, which can be described loosely as follows: \n• If the given instance of the problem can be solved directly, solve it directly.   \n• Otherwise, reduce it to one or more simpler instances of the same problem. \nIf the self-reference is confusing, it may be helpful to imagine that someone else is going to solve the simpler problems, just as you would assume for other types of reductions. I like to call that someone else the Recursion Fairy. Your only task is to simplify the original problem, or to solve it directly when simplification is either unnecessary or impossible; the Recursion Fairy will solve all the simpler subproblems for you, using Methods That Are None Of Your Business So Butt",

Your only task is to simplify the original problem, or to solve it directly when simplification is either unnecessary or impossible; the Recursion Fairy will solve all the simpler subproblems for you, using Methods That Are None Of Your Business So Butt \nOut.1 Mathematically sophisticated readers might recognize the Recursion Fairy by its more formal name: the Induction Hypothesis. \nThere is one mild technical condition that must be satisfied in order for any recursive method to work correctly: There must be no infinite sequence of reductions to simpler and simpler instances. Eventually, the recursive reductions must lead to an elementary base case that can be solved by some other method; otherwise, the recursive algorithm will loop forever. The most common way to satisfy this condition is to reduce to one or more smaller instances of the same problem. For example, if the original input is a skreeble with $n$ glurps, the input to each recursive call should be a skreeble with strictly less than $n$ glurps. Of course this is impossible if the skreeble has no glurps at all—You can’t have negative glurps; that would be silly!—so in that case we must grindlebloff the skreeble using some other method. \nWe’ve already seen one instance of this pattern in the peasant multiplication algorithm, which is based directly on the following recursive identity. \nThe same recurrence can be expressed algorithmically as follows: \nA lazy Egyptian scribe could execute this algorithm by computing $x ^ { prime }$ and $y ^ { prime }$ , asking a more junior scribe to multiply $x ^ { prime }$ and $y ^ { prime }$ , and then possibly adding $y$ to the junior scribe’s response. The junior scribe’s problem is simpler because $x ^ { prime } < x$ , and repeatedly decreasing a positive integer eventually leads to 0. How the junior scribe actually computes $x ^ { prime } cdot y ^ { prime }$ is none of the senior scribe’s business (and it’s none of your business, either). \n1.3 Tower of Hanoi \nThe Tower of Hanoi puzzle was first published—as an actual physical puzzle!—by the French teacher and recreational mathematician Édouard Lucas in 1883,2 under the pseudonym “N. Claus (de Siam)” (an anagram of “Lucas d’Amiens”). The following year, Henri de Parville described the puzzle with the following remarkable story:3 \nIn the great temple at Benares4...beneath the dome which marks the centre of the world, rests a brass plate in which are fixed three diamond needles, each a cubit high and as thick as the body of a bee. On one of these needles, at the creation, God placed sixty-four discs of pure gold, the largest disc resting on the brass plate, and the others getting smaller and smaller up to the top one. This is the Tower of Bramah. Day and night unceasingly the priests transfer the discs from one diamond needle to another according to the fixed and immutable laws of Bramah, which require that the priest on duty must not move more than one disc at a time and that he must place this disc on a needle so that there is no smaller disc below it. When the sixty-four discs shall have been thus transferred from the needle on which at the creation God placed them to one of the other needles, tower, temple, and Brahmins alike will crumble into dust, and with a thunderclap the world will vanish. \nOf course, as good computer scientists, our first instinct on reading this story is to substitute the variable $n$ for the hardwired constant 64. And because most physical instances of the puzzle are made of wood instead of diamonds and gold, I will call the three possible locations for the disks “pegs” instead of “needles”.

And because most physical instances of the puzzle are made of wood instead of diamonds and gold, I will call the three possible locations for the disks “pegs” instead of “needles”. How can we move a tower of $n$ disks from one peg to another, using a third spare peg as an occasional placeholder, without ever placing a disk on top of a smaller disk? \n\nAs N. Claus (de Siam) pointed out in the pamphlet included with his puzzle, the secret to solving this puzzle is to think recursively. Instead of trying to solve the entire puzzle at once, let’s concentrate on moving just the largest disk. We can’t move it at the beginning, because all the other disks are in the way. So first we have to move those $n - 1$ smaller disks to the spare peg. Once that’s done, we can move the largest disk directly to its destination. Finally, to finish the puzzle, we have to move the $n - 1$ smaller disks from the spare peg to their destination. \nSo now all we have to figure out is how to— \nNO!! STOP!! \nThat’s it! We’re done! We’ve successfully reduced the $n$ -disk Tower of Hanoi problem to two instances of the $( n - 1 )$ -disk Tower of Hanoi problem, which we can gleefully hand off to the Recursion Fairy—or to carry Lucas’s metaphor further, to the junior monks at the temple. Our job is finished. If we didn’t trust the junior monks, we wouldn’t have hired them; let them do their job in peace. \nOur reduction does make one subtle but extremely important assumption: There is a largest disk. Our recursive algorithm works for any positive number of disks, but it breaks down when $n = 0$ . We must handle that case using a different method. Fortunately, the monks at Benares, being good Buddhists, are quite adept at moving zero disks from one peg to another in no time at all, by doing nothing. \nIt may be tempting to think about how all those smaller disks move around— or more generally, what happens when the recursion is unrolled—but really, don’t do it. For most recursive algorithms, unrolling the recursion is neither necessary nor helpful. Our only task is to reduce the problem instance we’re given to one or more simpler instances, or to solve the problem directly if such a reduction is impossible. Our recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm is trivially correct when $n = 0$ . For any $n geq 1$ , the Recursion Fairy correctly moves the top $n - 1$ disks (more formally, the Inductive Hypothesis implies that our recursive algorithm correctly moves the top $n - 1$ disks) so our algorithm is correct. \nThe recursive Hanoi algorithm is expressed in pseudocode in Figure 1.4. The algorithm moves a stack of $n$ disks from a source peg (src) to a destination peg (dst) using a third temporary peg (tmp) as a placeholder. Notice that the algorithm correctly does nothing at all when $n = 0$ . \nLet $T ( n )$ denote the number of moves required to transfer $n$ disks—the running time of our algorithm. Our vacuous base case implies that $T ( 0 ) = 0$ , and the more general recursive algorithm implies that $T ( n ) = 2 T ( n - 1 ) + 1$ for any $n geq 1$ . By writing out the first several values of $T ( n )$ , we can easily guess that $T ( n ) = 2 ^ { n } - 1$ ; a straightforward induction proof implies that this guess is correct. In particular, moving a tower of 64 disks requires $2 ^ { 6 4 } - 1 =$ $1 8 , 4 4 6 , 7 4 4 , 0 7 3 , 7 0 9 , 5 5 1 , 6 1 5$ individual moves. Thus, even at the impressive rate of one move per second, the monks at Benares will be at work for approximately $5 8 5$ billion years (“plus de cinq milliards de siècles”) before tower, temple, and Brahmins alike will crumble into dust, and with a thunderclap the world will vanish. \n1.4 Mergesort \nMergesort is one of the earliest algorithms designed for general-purpose storedprogram computers. The algorithm was developed by John von Neumann in 1945, and described in detail in a publication with Herman Goldstine in 1947, as one of the first non-numerical programs for the EDVAC.5",

The merge algorithm is also recursive—identify the first element of the output array, and then recursively merge the rest of the input arrays. \nCorrectness \nTo prove that this algorithm is correct, we apply our old friend induction twice, first to the Merge subroutine then to the top-level Mergesort algorithm. \nLemma 1.1.

We prove that for all $k$ from 0 to $n$ , the last $n - k - 1$ iterations of the main loop correctly merge $A [ i ldots m ]$ and $A [ j ldots n ]$ into $B [ k . . n ]$ . The proof proceeds by induction on $n - k + 1$ , the number of elements remaining to be merged. \nIf $k > n$ , the algorithm correctly merges the two empty subarrays by doing absolutely nothing.

Otherwise, there are four cases to consider for the kth iteration of the main loop. \n• If $j > n$ , then subarray $A [ j ldots n ]$ is empty, so $operatorname* { m i n } left( A [ i ldots m ] cup A [ j ldots n ] right) = A [ i ]$ .   \n• If $i > m$ , then subarray $A [ i ldots m ]$ is empty, $operatorname { s o } operatorname* { m i n } left( A [ i ldots m ] cup A [ j ldots n ] right) = A [ j ]$ .   \n• Otherwise, if $A [ i ] < A [ j ]$ , then $operatorname* { m i n } left( A [ i ldots m ] cup A [ j ldots n ] right) = A [ i ]$ .   \n• Otherwise, we must have $A [ i ] geq A [ j ]$ , and $operatorname* { m i n } { big ( } A [ i ldots m ] cup A [ j ldots n ] { big ) } = A [ j ]$ . \nIn all four cases, $B [ k ]$ is correctly assigned the smallest element of $A [ i ldots m ] cup$ $A [ j ldots n ]$ .

Partition clearly runs in $O ( n )$ time, because it’s a simple for-loop with constant work per iteration. For QuickSort, we get a recurrence that depends on $r$ , the rank of the chosen pivot element: \nIf we could somehow always magically choose the pivot to be the median element of the array $A$ , we would have $r = lceil n / 2 rceil$ , the two subproblems would be as close to the same size as possible, the recurrence would become \nand we’d have $T ( n ) = O ( n log n )$ using either the recursion tree method or the even simpler “Oh yeah, we already solved that recurrence for mergesort” method. \nIn fact, as we will see later in this chapter, we can actually locate the median element in an unsorted array in linear time, but the algorithm is fairly complicated, and the hidden constant in the $O ( cdot )$ notation is large enough to make the resulting sorting algorithm impractical. In practice, most programmers settle for something simple, like choosing the first or last element of the array. In this case, $r$ can take any value between 1 and $n$ , so we have \nIn the worst case, the two subproblems are completely unbalanced—either $r = 1$ or $r = n$ —and the recurrence becomes $T ( n ) leq T ( n - 1 ) + O ( n )$ . The solution is $T ( n ) = O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ . \nAnother common heuristic is called “median of three”—choose three elements (usually at the beginning, middle, and end of the array), and take the median of those three elements as the pivot. Although this heuristic is somewhat more efficient in practice than just choosing one element, especially when the array is already (nearly) sorted, we can still have $r = 2$ or $r = n - 1$ in the worst case. With the median-of-three heuristic, the recurrence becomes $T ( n ) leq T ( 1 ) + T ( n - 2 ) + O ( n )$ , whose solution is still $T ( n ) = O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ .",

For QuickSort, we get a recurrence that depends on $r$ , the rank of the chosen pivot element: \nIf we could somehow always magically choose the pivot to be the median element of the array $A$ , we would have $r = lceil n / 2 rceil$ , the two subproblems would be as close to the same size as possible, the recurrence would become \nand we’d have $T ( n ) = O ( n log n )$ using either the recursion tree method or the even simpler “Oh yeah, we already solved that recurrence for mergesort” method. \nIn fact, as we will see later in this chapter, we can actually locate the median element in an unsorted array in linear time, but the algorithm is fairly complicated, and the hidden constant in the $O ( cdot )$ notation is large enough to make the resulting sorting algorithm impractical. In practice, most programmers settle for something simple, like choosing the first or last element of the array. In this case, $r$ can take any value between 1 and $n$ , so we have \nIn the worst case, the two subproblems are completely unbalanced—either $r = 1$ or $r = n$ —and the recurrence becomes $T ( n ) leq T ( n - 1 ) + O ( n )$ . The solution is $T ( n ) = O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ . \nAnother common heuristic is called “median of three”—choose three elements (usually at the beginning, middle, and end of the array), and take the median of those three elements as the pivot. Although this heuristic is somewhat more efficient in practice than just choosing one element, especially when the array is already (nearly) sorted, we can still have $r = 2$ or $r = n - 1$ in the worst case. With the median-of-three heuristic, the recurrence becomes $T ( n ) leq T ( 1 ) + T ( n - 2 ) + O ( n )$ , whose solution is still $T ( n ) = O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ . \nIntuitively, the pivot element should “usually” fall somewhere in the middle of the array, say with rank between $n / 1 0$ and $9 n / 1 0$ . This observation suggests that the “average-case” running time should be $O ( n log { n } )$ . Although this intuition can be formalized, the most common formalization makes the completely unrealistic assumption that all permutations of the input array are equally likely. Real world data may be random, but it is not random in any way that we can predict in advance, and it is certainly not uniform!7 \nOccasionally people also consider “best case” running time for some reason. We won’t. \n1.6 The Pattern \nBoth mergesort and quicksort follow a general three-step pattern called divide and conquer: \n1. Divide the given instance of the problem into several independent smaller instances of exactly the same problem.   \n2. Delegate each smaller instance to the Recursion Fairy.   \n3. Combine the solutions for the smaller instances into the final solution for the given instance. \nIf the size of any instance falls below some constant threshold, we abandon recursion and solve the problem directly, by brute force, in constant time. \nProving a divide-and-conquer algorithm correct almost always requires induction. Analyzing the running time requires setting up and solving a recurrence, which usually (but unfortunately not always!) can be solved using recursion trees. \n1.7 Recursion Trees \nSo what are these “recursion trees” I keep talking about? Recursion trees are a simple, general, pictorial tool for solving divide-and-conquer recurrences. A recursion tree is a rooted tree with one node for each recursive subproblem. The value of each node is the amount of time spent on the corresponding subproblem excluding recursive calls. Thus, the overall running time of the algorithm is the sum of the values of all nodes in the tree. \nTo make this idea more concrete, imagine a divide-and-conquer algorithm that spends $O ( f ( n ) )$ time on non-recursive work, and then makes $r$ recursive calls, each on a problem of size $n / c$ . Up to constant factors (which we can hide in the $O ( )$ notation), the running time of this algorithm is governed by the recurrence",

For purposes of illustration, imagine that we sort every column from top down, and then we sort the columns by their middle element. (Let me emphasize that the algorithm does not actually do this!)

The second key insight is that the total size of the two recursive subproblems is a constant factor smaller than the size of the original input array. The worst-case running time of the algorithm obeys the recurrence \nIf we draw out the recursion tree for this recurrence, we observe that the total work at each level of the recursion tree is at most $9 / 1 0$ the total work at the previous level.

Almost exactly a week later, a 23-year-old student named Anatoliı˘ Karatsuba presented Kolmogorov with a remarkable counterexample. According to Karatsuba himself, \nAfter the seminar I told Kolmogorov about the new algorithm and about the disproof of the $n ^ { 2 }$ conjecture. Kolmogorov was very agitated because this contradicted his very plausible conjecture. At the next meeting of the seminar, Kolmogorov himself told the participants about my method, and at that point the seminar was terminated. \nKaratsuba observed that the middle coefficient $b c + a d$ can be computed from the other two coefficients ac and $b d$ using only one more recursive multiplication, via the following algebraic identity: \nThis trick lets us replace the four recursive calls in the previous algorithm with only three recursive calls, as shown below: \nThe running time of Karatsuba’s FastMultiply algorithm follows the recurrence \nOnce again, the recursion tree method transforms this recurrence into an increasing geometric series, but the new solution is only $T ( n ) = O ( n ^ { log _ { 2 } 3 } ) =$ $O ( n ^ { 1 . 5 8 4 9 6 } )$ , a significant improvement over our earlier quadratic time bound.10 \nKaratsuba’s algorithm arguably launched the design and analysis of algorithms as a formal field of study. \nWe can take Karatsuba’s idea even further, splitting the numbers into more pieces and combining them in more complicated ways, to obtain even faster multiplication algorithms. Andrei Toom discovered an infinite family of algorithms that split any integer into $k$ parts, each with $n / k$ digits, and then compute the product using only $2 k - 1$ recursive multiplications; Toom’s algorithms were further simplified by Stephen Cook in his PhD thesis. For any fixed $k$ , the Toom-Cook algorithm runs in $O ( n ^ { 1 + 1 / ( lg k ) } )$ time, where the hidden constant in the $O ( cdot )$ notation depends on $k$ . \nUltimately, this divide-and-conquer strategy led Gauss (yes, really) to the discovery of the Fast Fourier transform.11 The basic FFT algorithm itself runs in $O ( n log { n } )$ time; however, using FFTs for integer multiplication incurs some small additional overhead.

        "content": "Karatsuba’s algorithm arguably launched the design and analysis of algorithms as a formal field of study. \nWe can take Karatsuba’s idea even further, splitting the numbers into more pieces and combining them in more complicated ways, to obtain even faster multiplication algorithms. Andrei Toom discovered an infinite family of algorithms that split any integer into $k$ parts, each with $n / k$ digits, and then compute the product using only $2 k - 1$ recursive multiplications; Toom’s algorithms were further simplified by Stephen Cook in his PhD thesis. For any fixed $k$ , the Toom-Cook algorithm runs in $O ( n ^ { 1 + 1 / ( lg k ) } )$ time, where the hidden constant in the $O ( cdot )$ notation depends on $k$ . \nUltimately, this divide-and-conquer strategy led Gauss (yes, really) to the discovery of the Fast Fourier transform.11 The basic FFT algorithm itself runs in $O ( n log { n } )$ time; however, using FFTs for integer multiplication incurs some small additional overhead. The first FFT-based integer multiplication algorithm, published by Arnold Schönhage and Volker Strassen in 1971, runs in $O ( n log n log log n )$ time. Schönhage-Strassen remained the theoretically fastest integer multiplication algorithm for several decades, before Martin Fürer discovered the first of a long series of technical improvements. Finally, in 2019, David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven published an algorithm that runs in $O ( n log { n } )$ time.12 \n1.10 Exponentiation \nGiven a number $a$ and a positive integer $n$ , suppose we want to compute $a ^ { n }$ . The standard naïve method is a simple for-loop that performs $n - 1$ multiplications by $a$ : \nThis iterative algorithm requires $n$ multiplications. \nThe input parameter $a$ could be an integer, or a rational, or a floating point number. In fact, it doesn’t need to be a number at all, as long as it’s something that we know how to multiply. For example, the same algorithm can be used to compute powers modulo some finite number (an operation commonly used in cryptography algorithms) or to compute powers of matrices (an operation used to evaluate recurrences and to compute shortest paths in graphs). Because we don’t know what kind of object we’re multiplying, we can’t know how much time a single multiplication requires, so we’re forced to analyze the running time in terms of the number of multiplications. \nThere is a much faster divide-and-conquer method, originally proposed by the Indian prosodist Pi˙ngala in the 2nd century bce, which uses the following simple recursive formula: \nThe total number of multiplications performed by this algorithm satisfies the recurrence $T ( n ) leq T ( n / 2 ) + 2$ . The recursion-tree method immediately give us the solution $T ( n ) = O ( log n )$ . \nA nearly identical exponentiation algorithm can also be derived directly from the Egyptian peasant multiplication algorithm from the previous chapter, by replacing addition with multiplication (and in particular, replacing duplation with squaring). \nThis algorithm—which might reasonably be called “squaring and mediation”— also performs only $O ( log n )$ multiplications. \nBoth of these algorithms are asymptotically optimal; any algorithm that computes $a ^ { n }$ must perform at least $Omega ( log n )$ multiplications, because each multiplication at most doubles the largest power computed so far. In fact, when $n$ is a power of two, both of these algorithms require exactly $log _ { 2 } n$ multiplications, which is exactly optimal. However, there are slightly faster methods for other values of $n$ . For example, Pin˙galaPower and PeasantPower each compute $a ^ { 1 5 }$ using six multiplications, but in fact only five multiplications are necessary: \n• Pi˙ngala: $a  a ^ { 2 }  a ^ { 3 }  a ^ { 6 }  a ^ { 7 }  a ^ { 1 4 }  a ^ { 1 5 }$ • Peasant: $a  a ^ { 2 }  a ^ { 4 }  a ^ { 8 }  a ^ { 1 2 }  a ^ { 1 4 }  a ^ { 1 5 }$ • Optimal: $a  a ^ { 2 }  a ^ { 3 }  a ^ { 5 }  a ^ { 1 0 }  a ^ { 1 5 }$ \nIt is a long-standing open question whether the absolute minimum number of multiplications for a given exponent $n$ can be computed efficiently. \nExercises \nTower of Hanoi \n1. Prove that the original recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm performs exactly the same sequence of moves—the same disks, to and from the same pegs, in the same order—as each of the following non-recursive algorithms.

The Tower of Hanoi is a relatively recent descendant of a much older mechanical puzzle known as the Chinese linked rings, Baguenaudier, Cardan’s Rings, Meleda, Patience, Tiring Irons, Prisoner’s Lock, Spin-Out, and many other names. This puzzle was already well known in both China and Europe by the 16th century. The Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli described the 7-ring puzzle and its solution in his unpublished treatise De Viribus Quantitatis, written between 1498 and 1506;13 only a few years later, the Ming-dynasty poet Yang Shen described the 9-ring puzzle as “a toy for women and children”. The puzzle is apocryphally attributed to a 2nd-century Chinese general, who gave the puzzle to his wife to occupy her time while he was away at war. \nThe Baguenaudier puzzle has many physical forms, but one of the most common consists of a long metal loop and several rings, which are connected to a solid base by movable rods. The loop is initially threaded through the rings as shown in Figure 1.16; the goal of the puzzle is to remove the loop. \nMore abstractly, we can model the puzzle as a sequence of bits, one for each ring, where the ith bit is 1 if the loop passes through the ith ring and 0 otherwise. (Here we index the rings from right to left, as shown in Figure 1.16.) The puzzle allows two legal moves: \n• You can always flip the 1st ( $mathbf { bar { Psi } } = mathbf { Psi }$ rightmost) bit.   \n• If the bit string ends with exactly $z  0 s$ , you can flip the $( z + 2 ) mathrm { t h }$ bit. \nThe goal of the puzzle is to transform a string of $n uparrow s$ into a string of $n  : 0 s$ . For example, the following sequence of 21 moves solves the 5-ring puzzle: \no(a) Call a sequence of moves reduced if no move is the inverse of the previous move. Prove that for any non-negative integer $n$ , there is exactly one reduced sequence of moves that solves the $n$ -ring Baguenaudier puzzle. [Hint: This problem is much easier if you’re already familiar with graphs.]   \n(b) Describe an algorithm to solve the Baguenaudier puzzle. Your input is the number of rings $n$ ; your algorithm should print a reduced sequence of moves that solves the puzzle. For example, given the integer 5 as input, your algorithm should print the sequence $1 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 5 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 3$ , $1 , 2 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 1$ .   \n(c) Exactly how many moves does your algorithm perform, as a function of n? Prove your answer is correct. \n3. A less familiar chapter in the Tower of Hanoi’s history is its brief relocation of the temple from Benares to Pisa in the early 13th century.14 The relocation was organized by the wealthy merchant-mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, at the request of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who had heard reports of the temple from soldiers returning from the Crusades. The Towers of Pisa and their attendant monks became famous, helping to establish Pisa as a dominant trading center on the Italian peninsula. \nUnfortunately, almost as soon as the temple was moved, one of the diamond needles began to lean to one side. To avoid the possibility of the leaning tower falling over from too much use, Fibonacci convinced the priests to adopt a more relaxed rule: Any number of disks on the leaning needle can be moved together to another needle in a single move. It was still forbidden to place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk, and disks had to be moved one at a time onto the leaning needle or between the two vertical needles. \nThanks to Fibonacci’s new rule, the priests could bring about the end of the universe somewhat faster from Pisa than they could from Benares. Fortunately, the temple was moved from Pisa back to Benares after the newly crowned Pope Gregory IX excommunicated Frederick II, making the local priests less sympathetic to hosting foreign heretics with strange mathematical habits. Soon afterward, a bell tower was erected on the spot where the temple once stood; it too began to lean almost immediately. \nDescribe an algorithm to transfer a stack of $n$ disks from one vertical needle to the other vertical needle, using the smallest possible number of moves. Exactly how many moves does your algorithm perform? \n4. Consider the following restricted variants of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle In each problem, the pegs are numbered 0, 1, and 2, and your task is to move a stack of $n$ disks from peg 0 to peg 2, exactly as in problem 1. \n(a) Suppose you are forbidden to move any disk directly between peg 1 and peg 2; every move must involve peg 0. Describe an algorithm to solve this version of the puzzle in as few moves as possible. Exactly how many moves does your algorithm make? pn(b) Suppose you are only allowed to move disks from peg 0 to peg 2, from peg 2 to peg 1, or from peg 1 to peg 0. Equivalently, suppose the pegs are arranged in a circle and numbered in clockwise order, and you are only allowed to move disks counterclockwise. Describe an algorithm to solve this version of the puzzle in as few moves as possible. How many moves does your algorithm make? \nn(c) Finally, suppose your only restriction is that you may never move a disk directly from peg 0 to peg 2. Describe an algorithm to solve this version of the puzzle in as few moves as possible. How many moves does your algorithm make? [Hint: Matrices! This variant is considerably harder to analyze than the other two.] \n5. Consider the following more complex variant of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle The puzzle has a row of $k$ pegs, numbered from 1 to $k$ . In a single turn, you are allowed to move the smallest disk on peg $i$ to either peg $i - 1$ or peg $i + 1$ , for any index $i$ ; as usual, you are not allowed to place a bigger disk on a smaller disk. Your mission is to move a stack of $n$ disks from peg 1 to peg $k$ . \n(a) Describe a recursive algorithm for the case $k = 3$ . Exactly how many moves does your algorithm make? (This is exactly the same as problem 4(a).)   \n(b) Describe a recursive algorithm for the case $k = n + 1$ that requires at most $O ( n ^ { 3 } )$ moves. [Hint: Use part (a).]   \nn(c) Describe a recursive algorithm for the case $k = n + 1$ that requires at most $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ moves.

(Which polynomial??)   \nn(e) Describe and analyze a recursive algorithm for arbitrary $n$ and $k$ .

You want to sort the pancakes so that smaller pancakes are on top of larger pancakes. The only operation you can perform is a flip—insert a spatula under the top $k$ pancakes, for some integer $k$ between 1 and $n$ , and flip them all over. \n(a) Describe an algorithm to sort an arbitrary stack of $n$ pancakes using $O ( n )$ flips. Exactly how many flips does your algorithm perform in the worst case?15 [Hint: This problem has nothing to do with the Tower of Hanoi.] \n(b) For every positive integer $n$ , describe a stack of $n$ pancakes that requires $Omega ( n )$ flips to sort.   \n(c) Now suppose one side of each pancake is burned. Describe an algorithm to sort an arbitrary stack of $n$ pancakes, so that the burned side of every pancake is facing down, using $O ( n )$ flips. Exactly how many flips does your algorithm perform in the worst case? \n10. Recall that the median-of-three heuristic examines the first, last, and middle element of the array, and uses the median of those three elements as a quicksort pivot. Prove that quicksort with the median-of-three heuristic requires $Omega ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time to sort an array of size $n$ in the worst case. Specifically, for any integer $n$ , describe a permutation of the integers 1 through $n$ , such that in every recursive call to median-of-three-quicksort, the pivot is always the second smallest element of the array. Designing this permutation requires intimate knowledge of the Partition subroutine. \n(a) As a warm-up exercise, assume that the Partition subroutine is stable, meaning it preserves the existing order of all elements smaller than the pivot, and it preserves the existing order of all elements smaller than the pivot.   \nn(b) Assume that the Partition subroutine uses the specific algorithm listed on page 29, which is not stable. \n11. (a) Hey, Moe! Hey, Larry! Prove that the following algorithm actually sorts its input! \n(b) Would StoogeSort still sort correctly if we replaced $m = lceil 2 n / 3 rceil$ with $begin{array} { r } { m = lfloor 2 n / 3 rfloor ? } end{array}$ Justify your answer.   \n(c) State a recurrence (including the base case(s)) for the number of comparisons executed by StoogeSort.   \n(d) Solve the recurrence, and prove that your solution is correct. [Hint: Ignore the ceiling.]   \n(e) Prove that the number of swaps executed by StoogeSort is at most $binom { n } { 2 }$ \n12. The following cruel and unusual sorting algorithm was proposed by Gary Miller: \nThe comparisons performed by this algorithm do not depend at all on the values in the input array; such a sorting algorithm is called oblivious. Assume for this problem that the input size $n$ is always a power of 2. \n(a) Prove by induction that Cruel correctly sorts any input array. [Hint: Consider an array that contains $n / 4 1 s , n / 4 2 s , n / 4 3 s ,$ and $n / 4 4 s$ . Why is this special case enough?]   \n(b) Prove that Cruel would not correctly sort if we removed the for-loop from Unusual.   \n(c) Prove that Cruel would not correctly sort if we swapped the last two lines of Unusual.   \n(d) What is the running time of Unusual? Justify your answer.   \n(e) What is the running time of Cruel? Justify your answer. \n13. An inversion in an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ is a pair of indices $( i , j )$ such that $i < j$ and $A [ i ] > A [ j ]$ . The number of inversions in an $n$ -element array is between 0 (if the array is sorted) and $binom { n } { 2 }$ (if the array is sorted backward). Describe and analyze an algorithm to count the number of inversions in an $n$ -element array in $O ( n log { n } )$ time. [Hint: Modify mergesort.] \n14. (a) Suppose you are given two sets of $n$ points, one set ${ p _ { 1 } , p _ { 2 } , . . . , p _ { n } }$ on the line $y = 0$ and the other set ${ q _ { 1 } , q _ { 2 } , ldots , q _ { n } }$ on the line $y = 1$ . Create a set of $n$ line segments by connect each point $p _ { i }$ to the corresponding point $q _ { i }$ . Describe and analyze a divide-and-conquer algorithm to determine how many pairs of these line segments intersect, in $O ( n log { n } )$ time. [Hint: See the previous problem.] (b) Now suppose you are given two sets ${ p _ { 1 } , p _ { 2 } , . . . , p _ { n } }$ and ${ q _ { 1 } , q _ { 2 } , ldots , q _ { n } }$ of $n$ points on the unit circle. Connect each point $p _ { i }$ to the corresponding point $q _ { i }$ . Describe and analyze a divide-and-conquer algorithm to determine how many pairs of these line segments intersect in $O ( n log ^ { 2 } n )$ time. [Hint: Use your solution to part (a).] \n\nn(c) Describe an algorithm for part (b) that runs in $O ( n log { n } )$ time. [Hint: Use your solution from part (b)!] \n15. (a) Describe an algorithm that sorts an input array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ by calling a subroutine $mathsf { S Q R T S o R T } ( k )$ , which sorts the subarray $A { left[ k + 1 ldots k + { sqrt { n } } right] }$ in place, given an arbitrary integer $k$ between 0 and $n - { sqrt { n } }$ as input. (To simplify the problem, assume that $sqrt { n }$ is an integer.) Your algorithm is only allowed to inspect or modify the input array by calling SqrtSort; in particular, your algorithm must not directly compare, move, or copy array elements. How many times does your algorithm call SqrtSort in the worst case? p(b) Prove that your algorithm from part (a) is optimal up to constant factors. In other words, if $f ( n )$ is the number of times your algorithm calls SqrtSort, prove that no algorithm can sort using $o ( f ( n ) )$ calls to SqrtSort. (c) Now suppose SqrtSort is implemented recursively, by calling your sorting algorithm from part (a). For example, at the second level of recursion, the algorithm is sorting arrays roughly of size $n ^ { 1 / 4 }$ . What is the worst-case running time of the resulting sorting algorithm? (To simplify the analysis, assume that the array size $n$ has the form $2 ^ { 2 ^ { k } }$ , so that repeated square roots are always integers.) \nSelection \n16. Suppose we are given a set $s$ of $n$ items, each with a value and a weight. For any element $x in S$ , we define two subsets \n• $S _ { < x }$ is the set of elements of $s$ whose value is less than the value of $x$ . • $S _ { > x }$ is the set of elements of $s$ whose value is more than the value of $x$ \nFor any subset $R subseteq S$ , let $w ( R )$ denote the sum of the weights of elements in $R$ . The weighted median of $R$ is any element $x$ such that $w ( S _ { < x } ) leq w ( S ) / 2$ and $w ( S _ { > x } ) leq w ( S ) / 2$ . \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to compute the weighted median of a given weighted set in $O ( n )$ time. Your input consists of two unsorted arrays $S [ 1 . . n ]$ and $W [ 1 ldots n ]$ , where for each index i, the ith element has value $s [ i ]$ and weight $W [ i ]$ . You may assume that all values are distinct and all weights are positive. \n17. (a) Describe an algorithm to determine in $O ( n )$ time whether an arbitrary array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ contains more than $n / 4$ copies of any value. (b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine, given an arbitrary array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ and an integer $k$ , whether $A$ contains more than $k$ copies of any value. Express the running time of your algorithm as a function of both $n$ and $k$ . \nDo not use hashing, or radix sort, or any other method that depends on the precise input values, as opposed to their order. \n18. Describe an algorithm to compute the median of an array $A [ 1 ldots 5 ]$ of distinct numbers using at most 6 comparisons. Instead of writing pseudocode, describe your algorithm using a decision tree: A binary tree where each internal node contains a comparison of the form $begin{array} { r } { { } ^ { * } A [ i ] gtrless A [ j ]  ? { } ^ { * } } end{array}$ and each leaf contains an index into the array. \n19. Consider the generalization of the Blum-Floyd-Pratt-Rivest-Tarjan MomSelect algorithm shown in Figure 1.22, which partitions the input array into $lceil n / b rceil$ blocks of size $b$ , instead of $lceil n / 5 rceil$ blocks of size 5, but is otherwise identical. \n(a) State a recurrence for the running time of $mathbf { M o u } _ { b }$ Select, assuming that $b$ is a constant (so the subroutine MedianOfB runs in $O ( 1 )$ time). In particular, how do the sizes of the recursive subproblems depend on the constant $b ?$ Consider even $b$ and odd $b$ separately. (b) What is the worst-case running time of $mathbf { M o u } _ { 1 }$ Select? [Hint: This is a trick question.] $triangleq left( mathrm { c } right)$ What is the worst-case running time of $mathbf { M o u } _ { 2 }$ Select? [Hint: This is an unfair question!] n(d) What is the worst-case running time of $mathrm { M o M _ { 3 } S E L E C T ? }$ Finding an upper bound on the running time is straightforward; the hard part is showing that this analysis is actually tight. [Hint: See problem 10.] n(e) What is the worst-case running time of $mathbf { M o M _ { 4 } S E L E C T ? }$ Again, the hard part is showing that the analysis cannot be improved.16 (f) For any constants $b geq 5$ , the algorithm $mathbf { M o u } _ { b }$ Select runs in $O ( n )$ time, but different values of $b$ lead to different constant factors. Let $M ( b )$ denote the minimum number of comparisons required to find the median of $b$ numbers. The exact value of $M ( b )$ is known only for $b leq 1 3$ : \nFor each $b$ between 5 and 13, find an upper bound on the running time of $mathrm { M o m } _ { b }$ Select of the form $T ( n ) leq a _ { b } n$ for some explicit constant $boldsymbol { alpha } _ { b }$ .

Prove that the variant of the Blum-Floyd-Pratt-Rivest-Tarjan Select algorithm shown in Figure 1.23, which uses an extra layer of small medians to choose the main pivot, runs in $O ( n )$ time. \n21. (a) Suppose we are given two sorted arrays $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ and $B [ 1 ldots n ]$ . Describe an algorithm to find the median element in the union of $A$ and $B$ in $Theta ( log n )$ time. You can assume that the arrays contain no duplicate elements. (b) Suppose we are given two sorted arrays $A [ 1 ldots m ]$ and $B [ 1 ldots n ]$ and an integer $k$ . Describe an algorithm to find the $k$ th smallest element in $A cup B$ in $Theta ( log ( m + n ) )$ time. For example, if $k = 1$ , your algorithm should return the smallest element of $A cup B$ .)

In 1854, archaeologists discovered Sumerians clay tablets, carved around 2000bce, that list the squares of integers up to 59. This discovery led some scholars to conjecture that ancient Sumerians performed multiplication by reduction to squaring, using an identity like $x cdot y = ( x ^ { 2 } + y ^ { 2 } - ( x - y ) ^ { 2 } ) / 2$ . Unfortunately, those same scholars are silent on how the Sumerians supposedly squared larger numbers. Four thousand years later, we can finally rescue these Sumerian mathematicians from their lives of drudgery through the power of recursion! \n(a) Describe a variant of Karatsuba’s algorithm that squares any $n$ -digit number in $O ( n ^ { lg 3 } )$ time, by reducing to squaring three $lceil n / 2 rceil$ -digit numbers. (Karatsuba actually did this in 1960.)   \n(b) Describe a recursive algorithm that squares any $n$ -digit number in $O ( n ^ { log _ { 3 } 6 } )$ time, by reducing to squaring six $lceil n / 3 rceil$ -digit numbers.   \nn(c) Describe a recursive algorithm that squares any $n$ -digit number in $O ( n ^ { log _ { 3 } 5 } )$ time, by reducing to squaring only five $( n / 3 + O ( 1 ) )$ -digit numbers.

(a) Describe and analyze a variant of Karatsuba’s algorithm that multiplies any $m$ -digit number and any $n$ -digit number, for any $n geq m$ , in $O ( n m ^ { lg 3 - 1 } )$ time. (b) Describe an algorithm to compute the decimal representation of $2 ^ { n }$ in $O ( n ^ { lg 3 } )$ time, using the algorithm from part (a) as a subroutine.

[Hint: Watch out for an extra log factor in the running time.] n(d) Suppose we can multiply two $n$ -digit numbers in $O ( M ( n ) )$ time. Describe an algorithm to compute the decimal representation of an arbitrary $n$ -bit binary number in $O ( M ( n ) log n )$ time. [Hint: The analysis is the hard part; use a domain transformation.] \n24. Consider the following classical recursive algorithm for computing the factorial $n !$ of a non-negative integer $n$ : \n(a) How many multiplications does this algorithm perform? \n(b) How many bits are required to write $n !$ in binary? Express your answer in the form $Theta ( f ( n ) )$ , for some familiar function $f ( n )$ . [Hint: $( n / 2 ) ^ { n / 2 } <$ $n ! < n ^ { n } . 7$   \n(c) Your answer to (b) should convince you that the number of multiplications is not a good estimate of the actual running time of Factorial. We can multiply any $k$ -digit number and any l-digit number in $O ( k cdot l )$ time using either the lattice algorithm or duplation and mediation. What is the running time of Factorial if we use this multiplication algorithm as a subroutine? \n(d) The following recursive algorithm also computes the factorial function, but using a different grouping of the multiplications: \nWhat is the running time of $mathrm { F A L L I N G } ( n , n )$ if we use grade-school multiplication?

The greatest common divisor of two positive integer $x$ and $y$ , denoted $operatorname* { g c d } ( x , y )$ , is the largest integer $d$ such that both $x / d$ and $y / d$ are integers. Euclid’s Elements, written around 300bce, describes the following recursive algorithm to compute $operatorname* { g c d } ( x , y )$ : 17 \n(a) Prove that EuclidGCD correctly computes $operatorname* { g c d } ( x , y )$ .18 Specifically: \ni. Prove that EuclidGCD $( x , y )$ divides both $x$ and $y$ .   \nii. Prove that every divisor of $x$ and $y$ is a divisor of EuclidGCD $( x , y )$ . \n(b) What is the worst-case running time of EuclidGCD $( x , y )$ , as a function of $x$ and $y ?$ (Assume that computing $x - y$ requires $O ( log x + log y )$ time.) \n(c) Prove that the following algorithm also computes $operatorname* { g c d } ( x , y )$ : \n(d) What is the worst-case running time of FastEuclidGCD $( x , y )$ , as a function of $x$ and $y ?$ (Assume that computing $x$ mod $y$ takes $O ( log x cdot$ $log y .$ ) time.) \n(e) Prove that the following algorithm also computes $operatorname* { g c d } ( x , y )$ : \n(f) What is the worst-case running time of BinaryGCD $( x , y )$ , as a function of $x$ and $y ?$ (Assume that computing $x - y$ takes $O ( log x + log y )$ time, and computing $z / 2$ requires $O ( log z )$ time.) \nArrays \n26. Suppose you are given a $2 ^ { n } times 2 ^ { n }$ checkerboard with one (arbitrarily chosen) square removed. Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute a tiling of the board by without gaps or overlaps by L-shaped tiles, each composed of 3 squares. Your input is the integer $n$ and two $n$ -bit integers representing the row and column of the missing square. The output is a list of the positions and orientations of $( 4 ^ { n } - 1 ) / 3$ tiles. Your algorithm should run in $O ( 4 ^ { n } )$ time. [Hint: First prove that such a tiling always exists.] \n27. You are a visitor at a political convention (or perhaps a faculty meeting) with $n$ delegates; each delegate is a member of exactly one political party. It is impossible to tell which political party any delegate belongs to; in particular, you will be summarily ejected from the convention if you ask. However, you can determine whether any pair of delegates belong to the same party by introducing them to each other. Members of the same political party always greet each other with smiles and friendly handshakes; members of different parties always greet each other with angry stares and insults.19 \n(a) Suppose more than half of the delegates belong to the same political party. Describe an efficient algorithm that identifies all members of this majority party.   \n(b) Now suppose there are more than two parties, but one party has a plurality: more people belong to that party than to any other party. Present a practical procedure to precisely pick the people from the plurality political party as parsimoniously as possible, presuming the plurality party is composed of at least $p$ people. Pretty please. \n28. Smullyan Island has three types of inhabitants: knights always speak the truth; knaves always lie; and normals sometimes speak the truth and sometimes don’t. Everyone on the island knows everyone else’s name and type (knight, knave, or normal). You want to learn the type of every inhabitant. \nYou can ask any inhabitant to tell you the type of any other inhabitant. Specifically, if you ask “Hey $X$ , what is Y ’s type?” then $X$ will respond as follows: \n• If $X$ is a knight, then $X$ will respond with Y ’s correct type. • If $X$ is a knave, then $X$ could respond with either of the types that $Y$ is not. • If $X$ is a normal, then $X$ could respond with any of the three types. \nThe inhabitants will ignore any questions not of this precise form; in particular, you may not ask an inhabitant about their own type. Asking the same inhabitant the same question multiple times always yields the same answer, so there’s no point in asking any question more than once. \n(a) Suppose you know that a strict majority of inhabitants are knights. Describe an efficient algorithm to identify the type of every inhabitant.   \n(b) Prove that if at most half the inhabitants are knights, it is impossible to determine the type of every inhabitant. \n29. Most graphics hardware includes support for a low-level operation called blit, or block transfer, which quickly copies a rectangular chunk of a pixel map (a two-dimensional array of pixel values) from one location to another. This is a two-dimensional version of the standard C library function memcpy(). \nSuppose we want to rotate an $n times n$ pixel map $9 0 ^ { circ }$ clockwise. One way to do this, at least when $n$ is a power of two, is to split the pixel map into four $n / 2 times n / 2$ blocks, move each block to its proper position using a sequence of five blits, and then recursively rotate each block. (Why five? For the same reason the Tower of Hanoi puzzle needs a third peg.) Alternately, we could first recursively rotate the blocks and then blit them into place. \n(a) Prove that both versions of the algorithm are correct when $n$ is a power of 2.   \n(b) Exactly how many blits does the algorithm perform when $n$ is a power of 2?   \n(c) Describe how to modify the algorithm so that it works for arbitrary $n$ , not just powers of 2. How many blits does your modified algorithm perform?   \n(d) What is your algorithm’s running time if a $k times k$ blit takes $O ( k ^ { 2 } )$ time?   \n(e) What if a $k times k$ blit takes only $O ( k )$ time? \n30. An array $A [ 0 ldots n - 1 ]$ of $n$ distinct numbers is bitonic if there are unique indices $i$ and $j$ such that $A [ ( i - 1 ) { bmod { n } } ] < A [ i ] > A [ ( i + 1 ) { bmod { n } } ]$ and \n$A [ ( j - 1 ) { bmod { n } } ] > A [ j ] < A [ ( j + 1 ) { bmod { n } } ]$ . In other words, a bitonic sequence either consists of an increasing sequence followed by a decreasing sequence, or can be circularly shifted to become so. For example, \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to find the smallest element in an $n$ - element bitonic array in $O ( log n )$ time. You may assume that the numbers in the input array are distinct. \n31. Suppose we are given an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of $n$ distinct integers, which could be positive, negative, or zero, sorted in increasing order so that $A [ 1 ] < A [ 2 ] <$ $cdots < A [ n ]$ . \n(a) Describe a fast algorithm that either computes an index $i$ such that $A [ i ] = i$ or correctly reports that no such index exists.   \n(b) Suppose we know in advance that $A [ 1 ] > 0$ . Describe an even faster algorithm that either computes an index i such that $A [ i ] = i$ or correctly reports that no such index exists. [Hint: This is really easy.] \n32. Suppose we are given an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ with the special property that $A [ 1 ] geq A [ 2 ]$ and $A [ n - 1 ] leq A [ n ]$ . We say that an element $A [ x ]$ is a local minimum if it is less than or equal to both its neighbors, or more formally, if $A [ x - 1 ] geq A [ x ]$ and $A [ x ] leq A [ x + 1 ]$ . For example, there are six local minima in the following array: \n9 7 7 2 1 3 7 5 4 7 3 3 4 8 6 9 ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ \nWe can obviously find a local minimum in $O ( n )$ time by scanning through the array. Describe and analyze an algorithm that finds a local minimum in $O ( log n )$ time. [Hint: With the given boundary conditions, the array must have at least one local minimum. Why?] \n33. Suppose you are given a sorted array of $n$ distinct numbers that has been rotated $k$ steps, for some unknown integer $k$ between 1 and $n - 1$ . That is, you are given an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ such that some prefix $A [ 1 ldots k ]$ is sorted in increasing order, the corresponding suffix $A [ k + 1 ldots n ]$ is sorted in increasing order, and $A [ n ] < A [ 1 ]$ . \nFor example, you might be given the following 16-element array (where $k = 1 0 mathrm {  : }$ ): \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the unknown integer $k$ . (b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine if the given array contains a given number $x$ . \n34. At the end of the second act of the action blockbuster Fast and Impossible XIII¾: The Last Guardians of Expendable Justice Reloaded,the villainous Dr. Metaphor hypnotizes the entire Hero League/Force/Squad, arranges them in a long line at the edge of a cliff, and instructs each hero to shoot the closest taller heroes to their left and right, at a prearranged signal. \nSuppose we are given the heights of all $n$ heroes, in order from left to right, in an array $H t [ 1 ldots n ]$ . (To avoid salary arguments, the producers insisted that no two heroes have the same height.) Then we can compute the Left and Right targets of each hero in $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time using the following brute-force algorithm. \n(a) Describe a divide-and-conquer algorithm that computes the output of WhoTargetsWhom in $O ( n log { n } )$ time.   \n(b) Prove that at least $lfloor n / 2 rfloor$ of the $n$ heroes are targets. That is, prove that the output arrays $R [ 0 ldots n - 1 ]$ and $L [ 0 ldots n - 1 ]$ contain at least $lfloor n / 2 rfloor$ distinct values (other than None).   \n(c) Alas, Dr. Metaphor’s diabolical plan is successful. At the prearranged signal, all the heroes simultaneously shoot their targets, and all targets fall over the cliff, apparently dead. Metaphor repeats his dastardly experiment over and over; after each massacre, he forces the remaining heroes to choose new targets, following the same algorithm, and then shoot their targets at the next signal. Eventually, only the shortest member of the Hero Crew/Alliance/Posse is left alive.20 \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to compute the number of rounds before Dr. Metaphor’s deadly process finally ends. For full credit, your algorithm should run in $O ( n )$ time. \n35. You are a contestant on the hit game show “Beat Your Neighbors!” You are presented with an $m times n$ grid of boxes, each containing a unique number. It costs $$ 100$ to open a box. Your goal is to find a box whose number is larger than its neighbors in the grid (above, below, left, and right). If you spend less money than any of your opponents, you win a week-long trip for two to Las Vegas and a year’s supply of Rice-A-Ronitm, to which you are hopelessly addicted. \n(a) Suppose $m = 1$ . Describe an algorithm that finds a number that is bigger than either of its neighbors. How many boxes does your algorithm open in the worst case? n(b) Suppose $m = n$ . Describe an algorithm that finds a number that is bigger than any of its neighbors. How many boxes does your algorithm open in the worst case? ${ } ^ { mathsf { a w } } ( { mathsf { c } } )$ Prove that your solution to part (b) is optimal up to a constant factor. \n36. (a) Let $n = 2 ^ { ell } - 1$ for some positive integer $ell$ . Suppose someone claims to hold an unsorted array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of distinct $ell$ -bit strings; thus, exactly one $ell$ -bit string does not appear in $A$ . Suppose further that the only way we can access $A$ is by calling the function $mathrm { F E T C H B I T } ( i , j )$ , which returns the $j$ th bit of the string $A [ i ]$ in $O ( 1 )$ time. Describe an algorithm to find the missing string in $A$ using only $O ( n )$ calls to FetchBit. \nn(b) Now suppose $n = 2 ^ { ell } - k$ for some positive integers $k$ and $ell$ , and again we are given an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of distinct $ell$ -bit strings. Describe an algorithm to find the $k$ strings that are missing from $A$ using only $O ( n log k )$ calls to FetchBit. \nTrees \n37. For this problem, a subtree of a binary tree means any connected subgraph. A binary tree is complete if every internal node has two children, and every leaf has exactly the same depth. Describe and analyze a recursive algorithm to compute the largest complete subtree of a given binary tree. Your algorithm should return both the root and the depth of this subtree. See Figure 1.26 for an example. \n38. Let $T$ be a binary tree with $n$ vertices. Deleting any vertex $nu$ splits $T$ into at most three subtrees, containing the left child of $nu$ (if any), the right child of $nu$ (if any), and the parent of $nu$ (if any). We call $nu$ a central vertex if each of these smaller trees has at most $n / 2$ vertices. See Figure 1.27 for an example. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to find a central vertex in an arbitrary given binary tree. [Hint: First prove that every tree has a central vertex.] \n39. (a) Professor George O’Jungle has a 27-node binary tree, in which every node is labeled with a unique letter of the Roman alphabet or the character &. Preorder and postorder traversals of the tree visit the nodes in the following order: \n• Preorder: I Q J H L E M V O T S B R G Y Z K C A & F P N U D W X • Postorder: H E M L J V Q S G Y R Z B T C P U D N F W & X A K O I \nDraw George’s binary tree. \n(b) Recall that a binary tree is full if every non-leaf node has exactly two children. i. Describe and analyze a recursive algorithm to reconstruct an arbitrary full binary tree, given its preorder and postorder node sequences as input. ii. Prove that there is no algorithm to reconstruct an arbitrary binary tree from its preorder and postorder node sequences.   \n(c) Describe and analyze a recursive algorithm to reconstruct an arbitrary binary tree, given its preorder and inorder node sequences as input.   \n(d) Describe and analyze a recursive algorithm to reconstruct an arbitrary binary search tree, given only its preorder node sequence.   \nn(e) Describe and analyze a recursive algorithm to reconstruct an arbitrary binary search tree, given only its preorder node sequence, in $O ( n )$ time. \nIn parts (b)–(e), assume that all keys are distinct and that the input is consistent with at least one binary tree. \n40. Suppose we have n points scattered inside a two-dimensional box. A kdtree21 recursively subdivides the points as follows. If the box contains no points in its interior, we are done. Otherwise, we split the box into two smaller boxes with a vertical line, through a median point inside the box (not on its boundary), partitioning the points as evenly as possible. Then we recursively build a kd-tree for the points in each of the two smaller boxes, after rotating them 90 degrees. Thus, we alternate between splitting vertically and splitting horizontally at each level of recursion. The final empty boxes are called cells. \n(a) How many cells are there, as a function of $n ?$ Prove your answer is correct.   \n(b) In the worst case, exactly how many cells can a horizontal line cross, as a function of $n ?$ Prove your answer is correct. Assume that $n = 2 ^ { k } - 1$ for some integer $k$ . [Hint: There is more than one function $f$ such that $f ( 1 6 ) = 4 . 7$   \n(c) Suppose we are given $n$ points stored in a kd-tree.

[Hint: Use part (c).] \nn41. Bob Ratenbur, a new student in CS 225, is trying to write code to perform preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals of binary trees. Bob sort-of understands the basic idea behind the traversal algorithms, but whenever he actually tries to implement them, he keeps mixing up the recursive calls. Five minutes before the deadline, Bob frantically submits code with the following structure: \nPreOrder(v): InOrder(v): PostOrder(v): if v = Null if v = Null if v = Null return return return else else else print label(v) Order(left(v)) Order(left(v)) Order(left(v)) print label(v) Order(right(v)) Order(right(v)) Order(right(v)) print label(v) \nEach in this pseudocode hides one of the prefixes Pre, In, or Post. Moreover, each of the following function calls appears exactly once in Bob’s submitted code: \nPreOrder(left(v)) PreOrder(right(v)) InOrder(left(v)) InOrder(right(v)) PostOrder(left(v)) PostOrder(right(v)) \nThus, there are precisely 36 possibilities for Bob’s code. Unfortunately, Bob accidentally deleted his source code after submitting the executable, so neither you nor he knows which functions were called where. \nNow suppose you are given the output of Bob’s traversal algorithms, executed on some unknown binary tree $T$ . Bob’s output has been helpfully parsed into three arrays $P r e [ 1 ldots n ] , I n [ 1 ldots n ] $ , and $P o s t [ 1 ldots n ]$ . You may assume that these traversal sequences are consistent with exactly one binary tree $T$ ; in particular, the vertex labels of the unknown tree $T$ are distinct, and every internal node in $T$ has exactly two children. \n(a) Describe an algorithm to reconstruct the unknown tree $T$ from the given traversal sequences.   \n(b) Describe an algorithm that either reconstructs Bob’s code from the given traversal sequences, or correctly reports that the traversal sequences are consistent with more than one set of algorithms. \nFor example, given the input \nyour first algorithm should return the following tree: \nand your second algorithm should reconstruct the following code: \n$^ { bullet } 4 2$ . Let $T$ be a binary tree whose nodes store distinct numerical values. Recall that $T$ is a binary search tree if and only if either (1) $T$ is empty, or (2) $T$ satisfies the following recursive conditions: \n• The left subtree of $T$ is a binary search tree.   \n• All values in the left subtree are smaller than the value at the root.   \n• The right subtree of $T$ is a binary search tree.   \n• All values in the right subtree are larger than the value at the root. \nConsider the following pair of operations on binary trees: \n• Rotate an arbitrary node upward.22 • Swap the left and right subtrees of an arbitrary node. \n\nIn both of these operations, some, all, or none of the subtrees $A , B$ , and $C$ could be empty. \n(a) Describe an algorithm to transform an arbitrary $n$ -node binary tree with distinct node values into a binary search tree, using at most $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ rotations and swaps. Figure 1.29 shows a sequence of eight operations that transforms a five-node binary tree into a binary search tree. \nYour algorithm is not allowed to directly modify parent or child pointers, create new nodes, or delete old nodes; the only way to modify the tree is through rotations and swaps. \nOn the other hand, you may compute anything you like for free, as long as that computation does not modify the tree; the running time of your algorithm is defined to be the number of rotations and swaps that it performs. \nn(b) Describe an algorithm to transform an arbitrary $n$ -node binary tree into a binary search tree, using at most $O ( n log { n } )$ rotations and swaps. \n(c) Prove that any $n$ -node binary search tree can be transformed into any other binary search tree with the same node values, using only $O ( n )$ rotations (and no swaps).   \nn(d) Open problem: Either describe an algorithm to transform an arbitrary $n$ -node binary tree into a binary search tree using only $O ( n )$ rotations and swaps, or prove that no such algorithm is possible.

Whenever the algorithm needs to decide between multiple alternatives to the next component of the solution, it recursively evaluates every alternative and then chooses the best one. \n2.1 N Queens \nThe prototypical backtracking problem is the classical $pmb { n }$ Queens Problem, first proposed by German chess enthusiast Max Bezzel in 1848 (under his pseudonym “Schachfreund”) for the standard $8 times 8$ board and by François-Joseph Eustache Lionnet in 1869 for the more general $n times n$ board. The problem is to place $n$ queens on an $n times n$ chessboard, so that no two queens are attacking each other. \nFor readers not familiar with the rules of chess, this means that no two queens are in the same row, the same column, or the same diagonal. \nIn a letter written to his friend Heinrich Schumacher in 1850, the eminent mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss wrote that one could easily confirm Franz Nauck’s claim that the Eight Queens problem has 92 solutions by trial and error in a few hours. (“Schwer ist es übrigens nicht, durch ein methodisches Tatonniren sich diese Gewissheit zu verschaffen, wenn man 1 oder ein paar Stunden daran wenden will.”) His description Tatonniren comes from the French tâtonner, meaning to feel, grope, or fumble around blindly, as if in the dark. \nGauss’s letter described the following recursive strategy for solving the $n$ -queens problem; the same strategy was described in 1882 by the French recreational mathematician Édouard Lucas, who attributed the method to Emmanuel Laquière. We place queens on the board one row at a time, starting with the top row. To place the rth queen, we methodically try all n squares in row $r$ from left to right in a simple for loop. If a particular square is attacked by an earlier queen, we ignore that square; otherwise, we tentatively place a queen on that square and recursively grope for consistent placements of the queens in later rows. \nFigure 2.2 shows the resulting algorithm, which recursively enumerates all complete $n$ -queens solutions that are consistent with a given partial solution. Following Gauss, we represent the positions of the queens using an array $Q [ 1 . . n ]$ , where $Q [ i ]$ indicates which square in row i contains a queen. When PlaceQueens is called, the input parameter $r$ is the index of the first empty row, and the prefix $Q [ 1 ldots r - 1 ]$ contains the positions of the first $r - 1$ queens. In particular, to compute all $n$ -queens solutions with no restrictions, we would call PlaceQueens $( Q [ 1 ldots n ] , 1 )$ . The outer for-loop considers all possible placements of a queen on row $r$ ; the inner for-loop checks whether a candidate placement of row $r$ is consistent with the queens that are already on the first $r - 1$ rows. \nThe execution of PlaceQueens can be illustrated using a recursion tree. Each node in this tree corresponds to a recursive subproblem, and thus to a legal partial solution; in particular, the root corresponds to the empty board (with $r = 0 mathrm { AA }$ ). Edges in the recursion tree correspond to recursive calls. Leaves correspond to partial solutions that cannot be further extended, either because there is already a queen on every row, or because every position in the next empty row is attacked by an existing queen. The backtracking search for complete solutions is equivalent to a depth-first search of this tree.",

        "content": "2.2 Game Trees \nConsider the following simple two-player game1 played on an $n times n$ square grid with a border of squares; let’s call the players Horace Fahlberg-Remsen and Vera Rebaudi.2 Each player has $n$ tokens that they move across the board from one side to the other. Horace’s tokens start in the left border, one in each row, and move horizontally to the right; symmetrically, Vera’s tokens start in the top border, one in each column, and move vertically downward. The players alternate turns. In each of his turns, Horace either moves one of his tokens one step to the right into an empty square, or jumps one of his tokens over exactly one of Vera’s tokens into an empty square two steps to the right. If no legal moves or jumps are available, Horace simply passes. Similarly, Vera either moves or jumps one of her tokens downward in each of her turns, unless no moves or jumps are possible. The first player to move all their tokens off the edge of the board wins. (It’s not hard to prove that as long as there are tokens on the board, at least one player can legally move, and therefore someone eventually wins.) \n$^ 1 mathrm { I }$ don’t know what this game is called, or even if I’m reporting the rules correctly; I learned it (or something like it) from Lenny Pitt, who recommended playing it with fake-sugar packets at restaurants. \n2Constantin Fahlberg and Ira Remsen synthesized saccharin for the first time in 1878, while Fahlberg was a postdoc in Remsen’s lab investigating coal tar derivatives. In 1900, Ovidio Rebaudi published the first chemical analysis of ka’a he’ê, a medicinal plant cultivated by the Guaraní for more than 1500 years, now more commonly known as Stevia rebaudiana. \nUnless you’ve seen this game before3, you probably don’t have any idea how to play it well. Nevertheless, there is a relatively simple backtracking algorithm that can play this game—or any two-player game without randomness or hidden information that ends after a finite number of moves—perfectly. That is, if we drop you into the middle of a game, and it is possible to win against another perfect player, the algorithm will tell you how to win. \nA state of the game consists of the locations of all the pieces and the identity of the current player. These states can be connected into a game tree, which has an edge from state $x$ to state $y$ if and only if the current player in state $x$ can legally move to state y. The root of the game tree is the initial position of the game, and every path from the root to a leaf is a complete game. \nTo navigate through this game tree, we recursively define a game state to be good or bad as follows: \n• A game state is good if either the current player has already won, or if the current player can move to a bad state for the opposing player. • A game state is bad if either the current player has already lost, or if every available move leads to a good state for the opposing player. \nEquivalently, a non-leaf node in the game tree is good if it has at least one bad child, and a non-leaf node is bad if all its children are good. By induction, any player that finds the game in a good state on their turn can win the game, even if their opponent plays perfectly; on the other hand, starting from a bad state, a player can win only if their opponent makes a mistake. This recursive definition was proposed by Ernst Zermelo in 1913.4 \nThis recursive definition immediately suggests the following recursive backtracking algorithm to determine whether a given game state is good or bad. At its core, this algorithm is just a depth-first search of the game tree; equivalently, the game tree is the recursion tree of the algorithm! A simple modification of this backtracking algorithm finds a good move (or even all possible good moves) if the input is a good game state. \nAll game-playing programs are ultimately based on this simple backtracking strategy. However, since most games have an enormous number of states, it is not possible to traverse the entire game tree in practice. Instead, game programs employ other heuristics5 to prune the game tree, by ignoring states that are obviously (or “obviously”) good or bad, or at least better or worse than other states, and/or by cutting off the tree at a certain depth (or $p l y )$ and using a more efficient heuristic to evaluate the leaves. \n2.3 Subset Sum \nLet’s consider a more complicated problem, called SubsetSum: Given a set $X$ of positive integers and target integer $T$ , is there a subset of elements in $X$ that add up to $T ?$ Notice that there can be more than one such subset. For example, if $X = { 8 , 6 , 7 , 5 , 3 , 1 0 , 9 }$ and $T = 1 5$ , the answer is True, because the subsets ${ 8 , 7 }$ and ${ 7 , 5 , 3 }$ and ${ 6 , 9 }$ and ${ 5 , 1 0 }$ all sum to 15. On the other hand, if $X = { 1 1 , 6 , 5 , 1 , 7 , 1 3 , 1 2 }$ and $T = 1 5$ , the answer is False. \nThere are two trivial cases. If the target value $T$ is zero, then we can immediately return True, because the empty set is a subset of every set $X$ , and the elements of the empty set add up to zero.6 On the other hand, if $T < 0$ , or if $T neq 0$ but the set $X$ is empty, then we can immediately return False. \nFor the general case, consider an arbitrary element $x in X$ . (We’ve already handled the case where $X$ is empty.) There is a subset of $X$ that sums to $T$ if and only if one of the following statements is true:",

For example: \n• For the $n$ -queens problem, we must pass in not only the number of empty rows, but the positions of all previously placed queens. Here, unfortunately, we must remember our past decisions in complete detail. • For the game tree problem, we only need to pass in the current state of the game, including the identity of the next player. We don’t need to remember anything about our past decisions, because who wins from a given game state does not depend on the moves that created that state.7 • For the SubsetSum problem, we need to pass in both the remaining available integers and the remaining target value, which is the original target value minus the sum of the previously chosen elements. Precisely which elements were previously chosen is unimportant. \nWhen we design new recursive backtracking algorithms, we must figure out in advance what information we will need about past decisions in the middle of the algorithm. If this information is nontrivial, our recursive algorithm might need to solve a more general problem than the one we were originally asked to solve. (We’ve seen this kind of generalization before: To find the median of an unsorted array in linear time, we derived an algorithm to select the kth smallest element for arbitrary $k$ .) \nFinally, once we’ve figured out what recursive problem we really need to solve, we solve that problem by recursive brute force: Try all possibilities for the next decision that are consistent with past decisions, and let the Recursion Fairy worry about the rest. No being clever here. No skipping “obviously” stupid choices. Try everything. You can make the algorithm faster later. \n2.5 Text Segmentation (Interpunctio Verborum) \nSuppose you are given a string of letters representing text in some foreign language, but without any spaces or punctuation, and you want to break this string into its individual constituent words. For example, you might be given the following passage from Cicero’s famous oration in defense of Lucius Licinius Murena in 62bce, in the standard scriptio continua of classical Latin:8",

        "content": "We are now left with a simple and natural backtracking strategy: Select the first output word, and recursively segment the rest of the input string. \nTo get a complete recursive algorithm, we need a base case. Our recursive strategy breaks down when we reach the end of the input string, because there is no next word. Fortunately, the empty string has a unique segmentation into zero words! \nPutting all the pieces together, we arrive at the following simple recursive algorithm: \nIndex Formulation \nIn practice, passing arrays as input parameters is rather slow; we should really find a more compact way to describe our recursive subproblems. For purposes of designing the algorithm, it’s incredibly useful to treat the original input array as a global variable, and then reformulate the problem and the algorithm in terms of array indices instead of explicit subarrays. \nFor our string segmentation problem, the argument of any recursive call is always a suffix $A [ i ldots n ]$ of the original input array. So if we treat the input array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ as a global variable, we can reformulate our recursive problem as follows: \nGiven an index $i$ , find a segmentation of the suffix $A [ i ldots n ]$ . \nTo describe our algorithm, we need two boolean functions: \n• For any indices $i$ and $j$ , let $mathrm { I s W o R D } ( i , j ) = mathrm { T R U E }$ if and only if the substring $A [ i . . j ]$ is a word. (We’re assuming this function is given to us.) • For any index $i$ , let Splittable $( i ) =$ True if and only if the suffix $A [ i ldots n ]$ can be split into words. (This is the function we need to implement.) \nFor example, $mathrm { I s W o R D } ( 1 , n ) = mathrm { T R U E }$ if and only if the entire input string is a single word, and Splittable $( 1 ) =$ True if and only if the entire input string can be segmented. Our earlier recursive strategy gives us the following recurrence: \nThis is exactly the same algorithm as we saw earlier; the only thing we’ve changed is the notation. The similarity is even more apparent if we rewrite the recurrence in pseudocode: \nAlthough it may look like a trivial notational difference, using index notation instead of array notation is an important habit, not only to speed up backtracking algorithms in practice, but for developing dynamic programming algorithms, which we discuss in the next chapter. \nnAnalysis \nIt should come as no surprise that most backtracking algorithms have exponential worst-case running times. Analyzing the precise running times of many of these algorithms requires techniques that are beyond the scope of this book. Fortunately, most of the backtracking algorithms we will encounter in this book are only intermediate results on the way to more efficient algorithms, which means their exact worst-case running time is not actually important. (First make it work; then make it fast.) \nBut just for fun, let’s analyze the running time of our recursive algorithm Splittable. Because we don’t know what IsWord is doing, we can’t know how long each call to IsWord takes, so we’re forced to analyze the running time in terms of the number of calls to IsWord.11 Splittable calls IsWord on every prefix of the input string, and possibly calls itself recursively on every suffix of the output string. Thus, the “running time” of Splittable obeys the scary-looking recurrence \nThis really isn’t as bad as it looks, especially once you’ve seen the trick. \nFirst, we replace the $O ( n )$ term with an explicit expression $a n$ , for some unknown (and ultimately unimportant) constant $alpha$ .

Our goal is to find a segmentation that maximizes the sum of the scores of the segments. \nFor any index $i$ , let MaxScore(i) denote the maximum score of any segmentation of the suffix $A [ i ldots n ]$ ; we need to compute MaxScore(1). This function satisfies the following recurrence: \nThis is essentially the same recurrence as the one we developed for Splittable; the only difference is that the boolean operations $vee$ and $wedge$ have been replaced by the numerical operations max and $^ +$ . \n2.6 Longest Increasing Subsequence \nFor any sequence S, a subsequence of $s$ is another sequence obtained from $s$ by deleting zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements; the elements of the subsequence need not be contiguous in S. For example, when you drive down a major street in any city, you drive through a sequence of intersections with traffic lights, but you only have to stop at a subsequence of those intersections, where the traffic lights are red. If you’re very lucky, you never stop at all: the empty sequence is a subsequence of S. On the other hand, if you’re very unlucky, you may have to stop at every intersection: $s$ is a subsequence of itself. \nAs another example, the strings BENT, ACKACK, SQUARING, and SUBSEQUENT are all subsequences of the string SUBSEQUENCEBACKTRACKING, as are the empty string and the entire string SUBSEQUENCEBACKTRACKING, but the strings QUEUE and EQUUS and TALLYHO are not. A subsequence whose elements are contiguous in the original sequence is called a substring; for example, MASHER and LAUGHTER are both subsequences of MANSLAUGHTER, but only LAUGHTER is a substring. \nNow suppose we are given a sequence of integers, and we need to find the longest subsequence whose elements are in increasing order. More concretely, the input is an integer array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ , and we need to compute the longest possible sequence of indices $1 leq i _ { 1 } < i _ { 2 } < cdots < i _ { ell } leq n$ such that $A [ i _ { k } ] < A [ i _ { k + 1 } ]$ for all $k$ . \nOne natural approach to building this longest increasing subsequence is to decide, for each index $j$ in order from 1 to $n$ , whether or not to include $A [ j ]$ in the subsequence. Jumping into the middle of this decision sequence, we might imagine the following picture: \nAs in our earlier text segmentation examples, the black bar separates our past decisions from the portion of the input we have not yet processed. Numbers we have already decided to include are highlighted and bold; numbers we have already decided to exclude are grayed out. (Notice that the numbers we’ve decided to include are increasing!) Our algorithm must decide whether or not to include the number immediately after the black bar.",

        "content": "For any index $i$ , let MaxScore(i) denote the maximum score of any segmentation of the suffix $A [ i ldots n ]$ ; we need to compute MaxScore(1). This function satisfies the following recurrence: \nThis is essentially the same recurrence as the one we developed for Splittable; the only difference is that the boolean operations $vee$ and $wedge$ have been replaced by the numerical operations max and $^ +$ . \n2.6 Longest Increasing Subsequence \nFor any sequence S, a subsequence of $s$ is another sequence obtained from $s$ by deleting zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements; the elements of the subsequence need not be contiguous in S. For example, when you drive down a major street in any city, you drive through a sequence of intersections with traffic lights, but you only have to stop at a subsequence of those intersections, where the traffic lights are red. If you’re very lucky, you never stop at all: the empty sequence is a subsequence of S. On the other hand, if you’re very unlucky, you may have to stop at every intersection: $s$ is a subsequence of itself. \nAs another example, the strings BENT, ACKACK, SQUARING, and SUBSEQUENT are all subsequences of the string SUBSEQUENCEBACKTRACKING, as are the empty string and the entire string SUBSEQUENCEBACKTRACKING, but the strings QUEUE and EQUUS and TALLYHO are not. A subsequence whose elements are contiguous in the original sequence is called a substring; for example, MASHER and LAUGHTER are both subsequences of MANSLAUGHTER, but only LAUGHTER is a substring. \nNow suppose we are given a sequence of integers, and we need to find the longest subsequence whose elements are in increasing order. More concretely, the input is an integer array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ , and we need to compute the longest possible sequence of indices $1 leq i _ { 1 } < i _ { 2 } < cdots < i _ { ell } leq n$ such that $A [ i _ { k } ] < A [ i _ { k + 1 } ]$ for all $k$ . \nOne natural approach to building this longest increasing subsequence is to decide, for each index $j$ in order from 1 to $n$ , whether or not to include $A [ j ]$ in the subsequence. Jumping into the middle of this decision sequence, we might imagine the following picture: \nAs in our earlier text segmentation examples, the black bar separates our past decisions from the portion of the input we have not yet processed. Numbers we have already decided to include are highlighted and bold; numbers we have already decided to exclude are grayed out. (Notice that the numbers we’ve decided to include are increasing!) Our algorithm must decide whether or not to include the number immediately after the black bar. \n\nIn this example, we definitely cannot include 5, because then the selected numbers would no longer be in increasing order. So let’s skip ahead to the next decision: \nNow we can include 8, but it’s not obvious whether we should. Rather than trying to be “smart”, our backtracking algorithm will use simple brute force. \nFirst tentatively include the 8, and let the Recursion Fairy make the rest of the decisions.   \n• Then tentatively exclude the 8, and let the Recursion Fairy make the rest of the decisions. \nWhichever choice leads to a longer increasing subsequence is the right one. (This is precisely the same recursion pattern we used to solve SubsetSum.) \nNow for the key question: What do we need to remember about our past decisions? We can only include $boldsymbol { A } [ j ]$ if the resulting subsequence is in increasing order. If we assume (inductively!) that the numbers previously selected from $A [ 1 . . j - 1 ]$ are in increasing order, then we can include $boldsymbol { A } [ j ]$ if and only if $boldsymbol { A } [ j ]$ is larger than the last number selected from $A [ 1 ldots j - 1 ]$ . Thus, the only information we need about the past is the last number selected so far. We can now revise our pictures by erasing everything we don’t need: \n6 5? 8 9 7 9 3 2 3 8 4 6 2 6   \n6 8? 9 7 9 3 2 3 8 4 6 2 6 \nSo the problem our recursive strategy is actually solving is the following: \nGiven an integer prev and an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ , find the longest increasing subsequence of $A$ in which every element is larger than prev. \nAs usual, our recursive strategy requires a base case. Our current strategy breaks down when we get to the end of the array, because there is no “next number” to consider. But an empty array has exactly one subsequence, namely, the empty sequence. Vacuously, every element in the empty sequence is larger than whatever value you want, and every pair of elements in the empty sequence appears in increasing order. Thus, the longest increasing subsequence of the empty array has length 0. \nHere’s the resulting recursive algorithm: \nOkay, but remember that passing arrays around on the call stack is expensive; let’s try to rephrase everything in terms of array indices, assuming that the array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ is a global variable. The integer prev is typically an array element $A [ i ]$ , and the remaining array is always a suffix $A [ j ldots n ]$ of the original input array. So we can reformulate our recursive problem as follows: \nGiven two indices $i$ and $j$ , where $i < j$ , find the longest increasing subsequence of $A [ j ldots n ]$ in which every element is larger than $A [ i ]$ . \nLet LISbigger $( i , j )$ denote the length of the longest increasing subsequence of $A [ j ldots n ]$ in which every element is larger than $A [ i ]$ . Our recursive strategy gives us the following recurrence: \nAlternatively, if you prefer pseudocode: \nFinally, we need to connect our recursive strategy to the original problem: Finding the longest increasing subsequence of an array with no other constraints. The simplest approach is to add an artificial sentinel value $- infty$ to the beginning of the array. \nThe running time of LISbigger satisfies the Hanoi recurrence $T ( n ) leq$ $2 T ( n - 1 ) + O ( 1 )$ , which as usual implies that $T ( n ) = O ( 2 ^ { n } )$ . We really shouldn’t be surprised by this running time; in the worst case, the algorithm examines each of the $2 ^ { n }$ subsequences of the input array. \n2.7 Longest Increasing Subsequence, Take 2 \nThis is not the only backtracking strategy we can use to find longest increasing subsequences. Instead of considering the input sequence one element at a time, we could try to construct the output sequence one element at a time. That is, instead of asking “Is $A [ i ]$ the next element of the output sequence?”, we could ask directly, “Where is the next element of the output sequence, if any?” \nJumping into the middle of this strategy, we might be faced with the following picture. Suppose we just decided to include the 6 just left of the black bar in our output sequence, and we need to decide which element to the right of the bar to include next. \n3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5? 3? 5? 8? 9? 7? 9? 3? 2? 3? 8? 4? 6? 2? 6? \nOf course, we can only include numbers on the right that are greater than 6;   \notherwise, our output sequence would not be increasing. \nBut we have no idea which of those larger numbers is the best choice, and trying to cleverly figure out the best choice is too much work, and it’s only going to get us into trouble anyway. Instead, we enumerate all possibilities by brute force, and let the Recursion Fairy evaluate each one.",

Instead, we enumerate all possibilities by brute force, and let the Recursion Fairy evaluate each one. \nThe subset of numbers we can consider as the next element depends only on the last number we decided to include. Thus, we can simplify our picture of the decision process by discarding everything to the left of the bar except the last number we decided to include. \n6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9 3 2 3 8 4 6 2 6 \nThe remaining sequence of numbers is just a suffix of the original input array. Thus, if we think of the input array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ as a global variable, we can formally express our recursive problem in terms of indices as follows: \nGiven an index i, find the longest increasing subsequence of $A [ i ldots n ]$ that begins with A[i]. \nLet LISfirst(i) denote the length of the longest increasing subsequence of $A [ i ldots n ]$ that begins with $A [ i ]$ . We can now formulate our recursive backtracking strategy as the following recursive definition: \nBecause we are dealing with sets of natural numbers, we define max $varnothing = 0$ . Then we automatically have $L I S f i r s t ( i ) = 1$ if $A [ j ] leq A [ i ]$ for all $j > i$ ; in particular, $L I S f i r s t ( n ) = 1$ . These are the base cases for our recurrence. \nWe can also express this recursive definition in pseudocode as follows: \nFinally, we need to reconnect this recursive algorithm to our original problem—finding the longest increasing subsequence without knowing its first element. One natural approach that works is to try all possible first elements by brute force. Equivalently, we can add a sentinel element $- infty$ to the beginning of the array, find the longest increasing subsequence that starts with the sentinel, and finally ignore the sentinel. \n2.8 Optimal Binary Search Trees \nOur final example combines recursive backtracking with the divide-and-conquer strategy. Recall that the running time for a successful search in a binary search tree is proportional to the number of ancestors of the target node.13 As a result, the worst-case search time is proportional to the depth of the tree. Thus, to minimize the worst-case search time, the height of the tree should be as small as possible; by this metric, the ideal tree is perfectly balanced. \nIn many applications of binary search trees, however, it is more important to minimize the total cost of several searches rather than the worst-case cost of a single search. If $x$ is a more frequent search target than y, we can save time by building a tree where the depth of $x$ is smaller than the depth of $y$ , even if that means increasing the overall depth of the tree. A perfectly balanced tree is not the best choice if some items are significantly more popular than others. In fact, a totally unbalanced tree with depth $Omega ( n )$ might actually be the best choice! \nThis situation suggests the following problem. Suppose we are given a sorted array of keys $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ and an array of corresponding access frequencies $f [ 1 . . n ]$ . Our task is to build the binary search tree that minimizes the total search time, assuming that there will be exactly $f [ i ]$ searches for each key A[i]. \nBefore we think about how to solve this problem, we should first come up with a good recursive definition of the function we are trying to optimize! Suppose we are also given a binary search tree $T$ with $n$ nodes. Let $nu _ { 1 } , nu _ { 2 } , ldots , nu _ { n }$ be the nodes of $T$ , indexed in sorted order, so that each node $nu _ { i }$ stores the corresponding key $A [ i ]$ . Then ignoring constant factors, the total cost of performing all the binary searches is given by the following expression: \nNow suppose $nu _ { r }$ is the root of $T$ ; by definition, $nu _ { r }$ is an ancestor of every node in $T$ . If $i < r$ , then all ancestors of $nu _ { i }$ except the root are in the left subtree of $T$ . Similarly, if $i > r$ , then all ancestors of $nu _ { i }$ except the root are in the right subtree of $T$ . Thus, we can partition the cost function into three parts as follows: \nThe second and third summations look exactly like our original definition $( * )$",

        "content": "for $C o s t ( T , f [ 1 . . n ] )$ . Simple substitution now gives us a recurrence for Cost: \nThe base case for this recurrence is, as usual, $n = 0$ ; the cost of performing no searches in the empty tree is zero. \nNow our task is to compute the tree $T _ { mathrm { o p t } }$ that minimizes this cost function. Suppose we somehow magically knew that the root of $T _ { mathrm { o p t } }$ is $nu _ { r }$ . Then the recursive definition of $C o s t ( T , f )$ immediately implies that the left subtree left $( T _ { mathrm { o p t } } )$ must be the optimal search tree for the keys $A [ 1 ldots r - 1 ]$ and access frequencies $f [ 1 ldots r - 1 ]$ . Similarly, the right subtree $r i g h t ( T _ { mathrm { o p t } } )$ must be the optimal search tree for the keys $A [ r + 1 ldots n ]$ and access frequencies $f [ r + 1 ldots n ]$ . Once we choose the correct key to store at the root, the Recursion Fairy will construct the rest of the optimal tree. \nMore generally, let $O p t C o s t ( i , k )$ denote the total cost of the optimal search tree for the interval of frequencies $f [ i ldots k ]$ . This function obeys the following recurrence. \nThe base case correctly indicates that the minimum possible cost to perform zero searches into the empty set is zero!

Not surprisingly, the running time of this algorithm is exponential. In the next chapter, we’ll see how to reduce the running time to polynomial, so there’s not much point in computing the precise running time. . . \nnAnalysis \n. unless you’re into that sort of thing. Just for the fun of it, let’s figure out how slow this backtracking algorithm actually is. The running time satisfies the recurrence \nThe $O ( n )$ term comes from computing the total number of searches $textstyle sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } f [ i ]$ . Yeah, that’s one ugly recurrence, but we can solve it using exactly the same \nsubtraction trick we used before.

The recursion tree method immediately gives us the solution $T ( n ) = O ( 3 ^ { n } )$ (or we can just guess and confirm by induction). \nThis analysis implies that our recursive algorithm does not examine all possible binary search trees!

(b) Describe a recursive backtracking algorithm to find the smallest number of symbols that can be removed from $Y$ so that $X$ is no longer a subsequence.

For example, the string PPAP appears as two disjoint subsequences in the string PENPINEAPPLEAPPLEPEN. Don’t analyze the running times of your algorithms, except to satisfy your own curiosity. All three algorithms run in exponential time; we’ll improve that later, so the precise running time isn’t particularly important. \n\n6. This problem asks you to design backtracking algorithms to find the cost of an optimal binary search tree that satisfies additional balance constraints. Your input consists of a sorted array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of search keys and an array $f [ 1 . . n ]$ of frequency counts, where $f [ i ]$ is the number of searches for $A [ i ]$ . This is exactly the same cost function as described in Section 2.8. But now your task is to compute an optimal tree that satisfies some additional constraints. \n(a) AVL trees were the earliest self-balancing balanced binary search trees, first described in 1962 by Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis. An AVL tree is a binary search tree where for every node $nu$ , the height of the left subtree of $nu$ and the height of the right subtree of $nu$ differ by at most one. \nDescribe a recursive backtracking algorithm to construct an optimal AVL tree for a given set of search keys and frequencies. \n(b) Symmetric binary $B$ -trees are another self-balancing binary trees, first described by Rudolf Bayer in 1972; these are better known by the name red-black trees, after a somewhat simpler reformulation by Leo Guibas and Bob Sedgwick in 1978. A red-black tree is a binary search tree with the following additional constraints: \n• Every node is either red or black.   \n• Every red node has a black parent.   \n• Every root-to-leaf path contains the same number of black nodes. \nDescribe a recursive backtracking algorithm to construct an optimal red-black tree for a given set of search keys and frequencies. \n(c) AA trees were proposed by proposed by Arne Andersson in 1993 and slightly simplified (and named) by Mark Allen Weiss in 2000. AA trees are also known as left-leaning red-black trees, after a symmetric reformulation (with different rebalancing algorithms) by Bob Sedgewick in 2006. An AA tree is a red-black tree with one additional constraint: • No left child is red.14 \nDescribe a recursive backtracking algorithm to construct an optimal AA tree for a given set of search keys and frequencies. \nDon’t analyze the running times of your algorithms, except to satisfy your own curiosity.

Classical Sanskrit poetry distinguishes between two types of syllables (ak.sara): light (laghu) and heavy (guru). In one class of meters, variously called m¯atr¯av.rtta or m¯atr¯achandas, each line of poetry consists of a fixed number of “beats” (ma¯tra¯), where each light syllable lasts one beat and each heavy syllable lasts two beats. The formal study of m¯atr¯a-v.rtta dates back to the Chanda.hś¯astra, written by the scholar Pi˙ngala between 600bce and 200bce. Pi˙ngala observed that there are exactly five 4-beat meters: —, and • • • •. (Here each “—” represents a long syllable and each “•” represents a short syllable.)1",

        "content": "Although Pin˙gala’s text hints at a systematic rule for counting meters with a given number of beats,2 it took about a millennium for that rule to be stated explicitly. In the 7th century ce, another Indian scholar named Viraha¯ .nka wrote a commentary on Pi˙ngala’s work, in which he observed that the number of meters with $n$ beats is the sum of the number of meters with $( n - 2 )$ beats and the number of meters with $( n - 1 )$ beats. In more modern notation, Viraha¯n. ka’s observation implies a recurrence for the total number $M ( n )$ of $n$ -beat meters: \nIt is not hard to see that $M ( 0 ) = 1$ (there is only one empty meter) and $M ( 1 ) = 1$ (the only one-beat meter consists of a single short syllable). \nThe same recurrence reappeared in Europe about 500 years after Viraha¯ .nka, in Leonardo of Pisa’s 1202 treatise Liber Abaci, one of the most influential early European works on “algorism”. In full compliance with Stigler’s Law of Eponymy,3 the modern Fibonacci numbers are defined using Virah¯an. ka’s recurrence, but with different base cases: \nIn particular, we have $M ( n ) = F _ { n + 1 }$ for all $n$ . \nBacktracking Can Be Slow \nThe recursive definition of Fibonacci numbers immediately gives us a recursive algorithm for computing them. Here is the same algorithm written in pseudocode: \n“dah-pause” is a guru ak.sara, and there are exactly five letters (M, D, R, U, and H) whose codes last four ma¯tra¯. \n2The Chanda.hśa¯stra contains two systematic rules for listing all meters with a given number of syllables, which correspond roughly to writing numbers in binary from left to right (like Greeks) or from right to left (like Egyptians). The same text includes a recursive algorithm to compute $2 ^ { n }$ (the number of meters with $n$ syllables) by repeated squaring, and (arguably) a recursive algorithm to compute binomial coefficients (the number of meters with $k$ short syllables and $n$ syllables overall). \n3“No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer.” In his 1980 paper that gives the law its name, the statistician Stephen Stigler jokingly claimed that this law was first proposed by sociologist Robert K. Merton. However, similar statements were previously made by Vladimir Arnol’d in the 1970’s (“Discoveries are rarely attributed to the correct person.”), Carl Boyer in 1968 (“Clio, the muse of history, often is fickle in attaching names to theorems!”), Alfred North Whitehead in 1917 (“Everything of importance has been said before by someone who did not discover it.”), and even Stephen’s father George Stigler in 1966 (“If we should ever encounter a case where a theory is named for the correct man, it will be noted.”). We will see many other examples of Stigler’s law in this book. \nUnfortunately, this naive recursive algorithm is horribly slow. Except for the recursive calls, the entire algorithm requires only a constant number of steps: one comparison and possibly one addition. Let $T ( n )$ denote the number of recursive calls to RecFibo; this function satisfies the recurrence \nwhich looks an awful lot like the recurrence for Fibonacci numbers themselves! Writing out the first several values of $T ( n )$ suggests the closed-form solution $T ( n ) = 2 F _ { n + 1 } - 1$ , which we can verify by induction (hint, hint). So computing $F _ { n }$ using this algorithm takes about twice as long as just counting to $F _ { n }$ . Methods beyond the scope of this book4 imply that $F _ { n } = Theta ( phi ^ { n } )$ , where $phi = ( sqrt { 5 } + 1 ) / 2 approx 1 . 6 1 8 0 3$ is the so-called golden ratio. In short, the running time of this recursive algorithm is exponential in $n$ . \nWe can actually see this exponential growth directly as follows. Think of the recursion tree for RecFibo as a binary tree of additions, with only 0s and 1s at the leaves. Since the eventual output is $F _ { n }$ , exactly $F _ { n }$ of the leaves must have value 1; these leaves represent the calls to RecRibo(1). An easy inductive argument (hint, hint) implies that RecFibo(0) is called exactly $F _ { n - 1 }$ times. (If we just want an asymptotic bound, it’s enough to observe that the number of calls to RecFibo(0) is at most the number of calls to RecFibo(1).) Thus, the recursion tree has exactly $F _ { n } + F _ { n - 1 } = F _ { n + 1 } = O ( F _ { n } )$ leaves, and therefore, because it’s a full binary tree, $2 F _ { n + 1 } - 1 = O ( F _ { n } )$ nodes altogether. \nMemo(r)ization: Remember Everything \nThe obvious reason for the recursive algorithm’s lack of speed is that it computes the same Fibonacci numbers over and over and over. A single call to RecFibo $( n )$ results in one recursive call to ${ mathrm { R E C F I B O } } ( n - 1 )$ , two recursive calls to ${ mathrm { R E C F I B O } } ( n - 2 )$ , three recursive calls to $operatorname { R E C F I B O } ( n - 3 )$ , five recursive calls to RecFibo $( n - 4 )$ , and in general $F _ { k - 1 }$ recursive calls to $mathrm { R E C F I B O } ( n - k )$ for any integer $0 leq k < n$ . Each call is recomputing some Fibonacci number from scratch. \nWe can speed up our recursive algorithm considerably by writing down the results of our recursive calls and looking them up again if we need them later.",

Each call is recomputing some Fibonacci number from scratch. \nWe can speed up our recursive algorithm considerably by writing down the results of our recursive calls and looking them up again if we need them later. \nThis optimization technique, now known as memoization (yes, without an R), is usually credited to Donald Michie in 1967, but essentially the same technique was proposed in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.5 \nMemFibo(n): if $n = 0$ return 0 else if $n = 1$ return 1 else if $F [ n ]$ is undefined F[n] MemFibo(n 1) + MemFibo(n 2) return F [n] \nMemoization clearly decreases the running time of the algorithm, but by how much? If we actually trace through the recursive calls made by MemFibo, we find that the array $F [ ]$ is filled from the bottom up: first $F [ 2 ]$ , then $F [ 3 ]$ , and so on, up to $F [ n ]$ . This pattern can be verified by induction: Each entry $F [ i ]$ is filled only after its predecessor $F [ i - 1 ]$ . If we ignore the time spent in recursive calls, it requires only constant time to evaluate the recurrence for each Fibonacci number $F _ { i }$ . But by design, the recurrence for $F _ { i }$ is evaluated only once for each index i. We conclude that MemFibo performs only $O ( n )$ additions, an exponential improvement over the naïve recursive algorithm! \nDynamic Programming: Fill Deliberately \nOnce we see how the array $F [ ]$ is filled, we can replace the memoized recurrence with a simple for-loop that intentionally fills the array in that order, instead of relying on a more complicated recursive algorithm to do it for us accidentally. \nNow the time analysis is immediate: IterFibo clearly uses $O ( n )$ additions and stores $O ( n )$ integers. \nThis is our first explicit dynamic programming algorithm.

Hero of the Beach! \n(This algorithm uses the non-standard but consistent base case $F _ { - 1 } = 1$ so that IterFibo2(0) returns the correct value 0.) Although saving space can be absolutely crucial in practice, we won’t focus on space issues in this book. \nn3.2 Aside: Even Faster Fibonacci Numbers \nAlthough the previous algorithm is simple and attractive, it is not the fastest algorithm to compute Fibonacci numbers. We can derive a faster algorithm by exploiting the following matrix reformulation of the Fibonacci recurrence: \nIn other words, multiplying a two-dimensional vector by the matrix $left[ ^ { 0 } _ { 1 } mathbf { right] }$ has exactly the same effect as one iteration of the inner loop of IterFibo2. It follows that multiplying by the matrix $n$ times is the same as iterating the loop $n$ times: \nSo if we want the $n$ th Fibonacci number, we only need to compute the nth power of the matrix $left[ ^ { 0 } _ { 1 } mathbf { right] }$ . If we use repeated squaring,9 computing the nth power of something requires only $O ( log n )$ multiplications. Here, because “something” is a $2 times 2$ matrix, that means $O ( log n )  b { 2 } times  b { 2 }$ matrix multiplications, each of which reduces to a constant number of integer multiplications and additions. Thus, we can compute $F _ { n }$ in only $O ( log n )$ integer arithmetic operations. \nWe can achieve the same speedup using the identity $F _ { n } = F _ { m } F _ { n - m - 1 } +$ $F _ { m + 1 } F _ { n - m }$ , which holds (by induction!) for all integers $m$ and $n$ . In particular, this identity implies the following mutual recurrence for pairs of adjacent Fibonacci numbers, first proposed by Édouard Lucas in 1898:",

        "content": "(We can also derive this mutual recurrence directly from the matrix-squaring algorithm.) These recurrences translate directly into the following algorithm: \nOur standard recursion tree technique implies that this algorithm performs only $O ( log n )$ integer arithmetic operations. \nThis is an exponential speedup over the standard iterative algorithm, which was already an exponential speedup over our original recursive algorithm. Right? \nWhoa! Not so fast! \nWell, not exactly. Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially fast. The nth Fibonacci number is approximately $n log _ { 1 0 } phi approx n / 5$ decimal digits long, or $n log _ { 2 } { phi } approx 2 n / 3$ bits. So we can’t possibly compute $F _ { n }$ in logarithmic time — we need $Omega ( n )$ time just to write down the answer! \nThe way out of this apparent paradox is to observe that we can’t perform arbitrary-precision arithmetic in constant time. Let $M ( n )$ denote the time required to multiply two $n$ -digit numbers. The running time of FastRecFibo satisfies the recurrence $T ( n ) = T ( lfloor n / 2 rfloor ) + M ( n )$ , which solves to $T ( n ) =$ $O ( M ( n ) )$ via recursion trees. The fastest integer multiplication algorithm known (as of 2019) runs in $O ( n log { n } )$ time, so that is also the running time of the fastest algorithm known (as of 2019) to compute Fibonacci numbers. \nIs this algorithm slower than our “linear-time” iterative algorithms? Actually, no—addition isn’t free, either! Adding two $n$ -digit numbers requires $O ( n )$ time, so the iterative algorithms IterFibo and IterFibo2 actually run in $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time. (Do you see why?) So FastRecFibo is significantly faster than the iterative algorithms, just not exponentially faster. \nIn the original recursive algorithm, the extra cost of arbitrary-precision arithmetic is overwhelmed by the huge number of recursive calls. The correct recurrence is $T ( n ) = T ( n - 1 ) + T ( n - 2 ) + O ( n ) _ { ! }$ , which still has the solution $T ( n ) = O ( phi ^ { n } )$ . \n\n3.3 Interpunctio Verborum Redux \nFor our next dynamic programming algorithm, let’s consider the text segmentation problem from the previous chapter. We are given a string $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ and a subroutine IsWord that determines whether a given string is a word (whatever that means), and we want to know whether $A$ can be partitioned into a sequence of words. \nWe solved this problem by defining a function Splittable(i) that returns True if and only if the suffix $A [ i ldots n ]$ can be partitioned into a sequence of words. We need to compute Splittable(1). This function satisfies the recurrence \nwhere $I s W o r d ( i , j )$ is shorthand for $I s W o r d ( A [ i dots j ] )$ . This recurrence translates directly into a recursive backtracking algorithm that calls the IsWord subroutine $O ( 2 ^ { n } )$ times in the worst case. \nBut for any fixed string $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ , there are only $n$ different ways to call the recursive function Splittable $( i )$ —one for each value of $i$ between 1 and $n + 1$ —and only $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ different ways to call IsWord $( i , j )$ —one for each pair $( i , j )$ such that $1 leq i leq j leq n$ . Why are we spending exponential time computing only a polynomial amount of stuff? \nEach recursive subproblem is specified by an integer between 1 and $n + 1$ , so we can memoize the function Splittable into an array SplitTable $cdot 1 ldots n + 1 ]$ . Each subproblem Splittable(i) depends only on results of subproblems Splittable $( j )$ where $j > i$ , so the memoized recursive algorithm fills the array in decreasing index order. If we fill the array in this order deliberately, we obtain the dynamic programming algorithm shown in Figure 3.3. The algorithm makes $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ calls to IsWord, an exponential improvement over our earlier backtracking algorithm. \n3.4 The Pattern: Smart Recursion \nIn a nutshell, dynamic programming is recursion without repetition.

Dynamic programming algorithms store the solutions of intermediate subproblems, often but not always in some kind of array or table. Many algorithms students \nFastSplittable(A[1 .. n]): SplitTable[n + 1] True for $i gets n$ down to 1 $S p l i t T a b l e [ i ] gets mathrm { F A L S E }$ for $j gets i$ to $n$ if $mathrm { I s W o r a p } ( i , j )$ and SplitTable[ j + 1] SplitTable[i] $$ True return SplitTable[1] \n(and instructors, and textbooks) make the mistake of focusing on the table— because tables are easy and familiar—instead of the much more important (and difficult) task of finding a correct recurrence. As long as we memoize the correct recurrence, an explicit table isn’t really necessary, but if the recurrence is incorrect, we are well and truly hosed. \nDynamic programming is not about filling in tables. It’s about smart recursion! \nDynamic programming algorithms are best developed in two distinct stages. \n1. Formulate the problem recursively. Write down a recursive formula or algorithm for the whole problem in terms of the answers to smaller subproblems. This is the hard part. A complete recursive formulation has two parts: \n(a) Specification. Describe the problem that you want to solve recursively, in coherent and precise English—not how to solve that problem, but what problem you’re trying to solve. Without this specification, it is impossible, even in principle, to determine whether your solution is correct.   \n(b) Solution. Give a clear recursive formula or algorithm for the whole problem in terms of the answers to smaller instances of exactly the same problem. \n2. Build solutions to your recurrence from the bottom up. Write an algorithm that starts with the base cases of your recurrence and works its way up to the final solution, by considering intermediate subproblems in the correct order. This stage can be broken down into several smaller, relatively mechanical steps: \n(a) Identify the subproblems. What are all the different ways your recursive algorithm can call itself, starting with some initial input? For example, the argument to RecFibo is always an integer between 0 and $n$ . \n(b) Choose a memoization data structure. Find a data structure that can store the solution to every subproblem you identified in step (a). This is usually but not always a multidimensional array.   \n(c) Identify dependencies. Except for the base cases, every subproblem depends on other subproblems—which ones? Draw a picture of your data structure, pick a generic element, and draw arrows from each of the other elements it depends on. Then formalize your picture.   \n(d) Find a good evaluation order. Order the subproblems so that each one comes after the subproblems it depends on. You should consider the base cases first, then the subproblems that depends only on base cases, and so on, eventually building up to the original top-level problem. The dependencies you identified in the previous step define a partial order over the subproblems; you need to find a linear extension of that partial order. Be careful!   \n(e) Analyze space and running time. The number of distinct subproblems determines the space complexity of your memoized algorithm. To compute the total running time, add up the running times of all possible subproblems, assuming deeper recursive calls are already memoized. You can actually do this immediately after step (a).   \n(f) Write down the algorithm. You know what order to consider the subproblems, and you know how to solve each subproblem. So do that! If your data structure is an array, this usually means writing a few nested for-loops around your original recurrence, and replacing the recursive calls with array look-ups. \nOf course, you have to prove that each of these steps is correct. If your recurrence is wrong, or if you try to build up answers in the wrong order, your algorithm won’t work! \n3.5 Warning: Greed is Stupid \nIf we’re incredibly lucky, we can bypass all the recurrences and tables and so forth, and solve the problem using a greedy algorithm. Like a backtracking algorithm, a greedy algorithm constructs a solution through a series of decisions, but it makes those decisions directly, without solving at any recursive subproblems. While this approach seems very natural, it almost never works; optimization problems that can be solved correctly by a greedy algorithm are quite rare. Nevertheless, for many problems that should be solved by backtracking or dynamic programming, many students’ first intuition is to apply a greedy strategy. \nFor example, a greedy algorithm for the text segmentation problem might find the shortest (or, if you prefer, longest) prefix of the input string that is a word, accept that prefix as the first word in the segmentation, and then recursively segment the remaining suffix of the input string. Similarly, a greedy algorithm for the longest increasing subsequence problem might look for the smallest element of the input array, accept that element as the start of the target subsequence, and then recursively look for the longest increasing subsequence to the right of that element. If these sound like stupid hacks to you, pat yourself on the back; these aren’t even close to correct solutions.",

        "content": "(b) Choose a memoization data structure. Find a data structure that can store the solution to every subproblem you identified in step (a). This is usually but not always a multidimensional array.   \n(c) Identify dependencies. Except for the base cases, every subproblem depends on other subproblems—which ones? Draw a picture of your data structure, pick a generic element, and draw arrows from each of the other elements it depends on. Then formalize your picture.   \n(d) Find a good evaluation order. Order the subproblems so that each one comes after the subproblems it depends on. You should consider the base cases first, then the subproblems that depends only on base cases, and so on, eventually building up to the original top-level problem. The dependencies you identified in the previous step define a partial order over the subproblems; you need to find a linear extension of that partial order. Be careful!   \n(e) Analyze space and running time. The number of distinct subproblems determines the space complexity of your memoized algorithm. To compute the total running time, add up the running times of all possible subproblems, assuming deeper recursive calls are already memoized. You can actually do this immediately after step (a).   \n(f) Write down the algorithm. You know what order to consider the subproblems, and you know how to solve each subproblem. So do that! If your data structure is an array, this usually means writing a few nested for-loops around your original recurrence, and replacing the recursive calls with array look-ups. \nOf course, you have to prove that each of these steps is correct. If your recurrence is wrong, or if you try to build up answers in the wrong order, your algorithm won’t work! \n3.5 Warning: Greed is Stupid \nIf we’re incredibly lucky, we can bypass all the recurrences and tables and so forth, and solve the problem using a greedy algorithm. Like a backtracking algorithm, a greedy algorithm constructs a solution through a series of decisions, but it makes those decisions directly, without solving at any recursive subproblems. While this approach seems very natural, it almost never works; optimization problems that can be solved correctly by a greedy algorithm are quite rare. Nevertheless, for many problems that should be solved by backtracking or dynamic programming, many students’ first intuition is to apply a greedy strategy. \nFor example, a greedy algorithm for the text segmentation problem might find the shortest (or, if you prefer, longest) prefix of the input string that is a word, accept that prefix as the first word in the segmentation, and then recursively segment the remaining suffix of the input string. Similarly, a greedy algorithm for the longest increasing subsequence problem might look for the smallest element of the input array, accept that element as the start of the target subsequence, and then recursively look for the longest increasing subsequence to the right of that element. If these sound like stupid hacks to you, pat yourself on the back; these aren’t even close to correct solutions. \n\nEveryone should tattoo the following sentence on the back of their hands, right under all the rules about logarithms and big-Oh notation: \nGreedy algorithms never work! Use dynamic programming instead! \nWhat, never?   \nNo, never!   \nWhat, never?   \nWell. . . hardly ever.10 \nBecause the greedy approach is so incredibly tempting, but so rarely correct, I strongly advocate the following policy in any algorithms course, even (or perhaps especially) for courses that do not normally ask for proofs of correctness.11 \nYou will not receive any credit for any greedy algorithm, on any homework or exam, even if the algorithm is correct, without a formal proof of correctness. \nMoreover, the vast majority of problems for which students are tempted to submit a greedy algorithm are actually best solved using dynamic programming. So I always offer the following advice to my algorithms students. \nWhenever you write—or even think—the word “greeDY”, your subconscious is telling you to use DYnamic programming. \nEven for problems that can be correctly solved by greedy algorithms, it’s usually more productive to develop a backtracking or dynamic programming algorithm first. First make it work, then make it fast. We will see techniques for proving greedy algorithms correct in the next chapter. \n3.6 Longest Increasing Subsequence \nAnother problem we considered in the previous chapter was computing the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a given array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of numbers. We developed two different recursive backtracking algorithms for this problem. Both algorithms run in $O ( 2 ^ { n } )$ time in the worst case; both algorithms can be sped up significantly via dynamic programming. \nFirst Recurrence: Is This Next? \nOur first backtracking algorithm evaluated the function LISbigger $( i , j )$ , which we defined as the length of the longest increasing subsequence of $A [ j ldots n ]$ in which every element is larger than $A [ i ]$ . We derived the following recurrence for this function: \nTo solve the original problem, we can add a sentinel value $A [ 0 ] = - infty$ to the array and compute LISbigger $( 0 , 1 )$ . \nEach recursive subproblem is identified by two indices $i$ and $j$ , so there are only $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ distinct recursive subproblems to consider. We can memoize the results of these subproblems into a two-dimensional array LISbigger $[ mathbf { 0 } . . . n , mathbf { 1 } . . . n ]$ .12 Moreover, each subproblem can be solved in $O ( 1 )$ time, not counting recursive calls, so we should expect the final dynamic programming algorithm to run in $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time. \nThe order in which the memoized recursive algorithm fills this array is not immediately clear; all we can tell from the recurrence is that each entry LISbigger $left[ i , j right]$ is filled in after the entries LISbigger $[ i , j + 1 ]$ and LISbigger $[ j , j + 1 ]$ in the next column, as indicated on the left in Figure 3.4. \nFortunately, this partial information is enough to give us a valid evaluation order. If we fill the table one column at a time, from right to left, then whenever we reach an entry in the table, the entries it depends on are already available. This may not be the order that the recursive algorithm would use, but it works, so we’ll go with it. The right figure in Figure 3.4 illustrates this evaluation order, with a double arrow indicating the outer loop and single arrows indicating the inner loop. In this case, the single arrows are bidirectional, because the order that we use to fill each column doesn’t matter.",

For example, the edit distance between FOOD and MONEY is at most four: \nThis distance function was independently proposed by Vladimir Levenshtein in 1965 (working on coding theory), Taras Vintsyuk in 1968 (working on speech recognition), and Stanislaw Ulam in 1972 (working with biological sequences). For this reason, edit distance is sometimes called Levenshtein distance or Ulam distance (but strangely, never “Vintsyuk distance”). \nWe can visualize this editing process by aligning the strings one above the other, with a gap in the first word for each insertion and a gap in the second word for each deletion. Columns with two different characters correspond to substitutions. In this representation, the number of editing steps is just the number of columns that do not contain the same character twice. \nIt’s fairly obvious that we can’t transform FOOD into MONEY in three steps, so the edit distance between FOOD and MONEY is exactly four. Unfortunately, it’s not so easy in general to tell when a sequence of edits is as short as possible. For example, the following alignment shows that the distance between the strings ALGORITHM and ALTRUISTIC is at most 6. Is that the best we can do?",

However, in full compliance with Stigler’s Law of Eponymy, either identical or more general algorithms were independently discovered by Taras Vintsyuk in 1968, V. M. Velichko and N. G. Zagoruyko in 1970, David Sankoff in 1972, Peter Sellers in 1974, and almost certainly several others.14 Interestingly, none of these authors cite either Levenshtein or Ulam! \n\nThe memoization table for the input strings ALGORITHM and ALTRUISTIC is shown below. Bold numbers indicate places where characters in the two strings are equal. The edit distance between ALGORITHM and ALTRUISTIC is indeed six! \nThe arrows in this table indicate which predecessor(s) actually define each entry. Each direction of arrow corresponds to a different edit operation: horizontal $ c =$ deletion, vertical $ c =$ insertion, and diagonal $ c =$ substitution. Bold red diagonal arrows indicate “free” substitutions of a letter for itself. Any path of arrows from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of this table represents an optimal edit sequence between the two strings. The example memoization array contains exactly three directed paths from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, each indicating a different sequence of six edits transforming ALGORITHM into ALTRUISTIC, as shown on the next page. \nA L G O R I T H M A L T R U I S T I C A L G O R I T H M A L T R U I S T I C A L G O R I T H M A L T R U I S T I C \nOur EditDistance algorithm does not actually compute or store any arrows in the table, but the arrow(s) leading into any entry in the table can be reconstructed on the fly in $O ( 1 )$ time from the numerical values.

We derived the following recurrence for the function OptCost: \nYou can probably guess what we’re going to do with this recurrence eventually, but let’s rid of that ugly summation first. \nFor any pair of indices $i leq k$ , let $F ( i , k )$ denote the total frequency count for all the keys in the interval $A [ i ldots k ]$ : \nThis function satisfies the following simple recurrence: \nWe can compute all possible values of $F ( i , k )$ in $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time using—you guessed it!—dynamic programming! The usual mechanical steps give us the following dynamic programming algorithm: \nWe will use this short algorithm as an initialization subroutine. This initialization allows us to simplify the original OptCost recurrence as follows: \nNow let’s turn the crank. \n• Subproblems: Each recursive subproblem is specified by two integers i and $k$ , such that $1 leq i leq n + 1$ and $0 leq k leq n$ . \n• Memoization: We can store all possible values of OptCost in a twodimensional array $O p t C o s t [ 1 ldots n + 1 , 0 ldots n ]$ . (Only the entries $O p t C o s t [ i , j ]$ with $j geq i - 1$ will actually be used, but whatever.) \n• Dependencies: Each entry $O p t C o s t [ i , k ]$ depends on the entries OptCost[i, $j - 1 ]$ and $O p t C o s t [ j + 1 , k ] _ { scriptscriptstyle cdot }$ , for all $j$ such that $i leq j leq k$ . In other words, each table entry depends on all entries either directly to the left or directly below. \nThe following subroutine fills the entry $O p t C o s t [ i , k ]$ , assuming all the entries it depends on have already been computed. \n• Evaluation order: There are at least three different orders that can be used to fill the array. The first one that occurs to most students is to scan through the table one diagonal at a time, starting with the trivial base cases $O p t C o s t [ i , i - 1 ]$ and working toward the final answer $O p t C o s t [ 1 , n ]$ , like so: \nWe could also traverse the array row by row from the bottom up, traversing each row from left to right, or column by column from left to right, traversing each columns from the bottom up. \nAs before, we can illustrate these evaluation orders using a double-lined arrow to indicate the outer loop and single-lined arrows to indicate the inner loop. The bidirectional arrows in the first evaluation order indicate that the order of the inner loops doesn’t matter. \nX 丰 • Time and space: The memoization structure uses $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ space. No matter which evaluation order we choose, we need $O ( n )$ time to compute each entry $O p t C o s t [ i , k ]$ , so our overall algorithm runs in $O ( n ^ { 3 } )$ time. \n\nAs usual, we could have predicted the final space and time bounds directly from the original recurrence: \nThe OptCost function has two arguments, each of which can take on roughly $n$ different values, so we probably need a data structure of size $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ . On the other hand, there are three variables in the body of the recurrence $( i , k ,$ and $r$ ), each of which can take roughly $n$ different values, so it should take $O ( n ^ { 3 } )$ time to compute everything. \n3.10 Dynamic Programming on Trees \nSo far, all of our dynamic programming examples use multidimensional arrays to store the results of recursive subproblems. However, as the next example shows, this is not always the most appropriate data structure to use. \nAn independent set in a graph is a subset of the vertices with no edges between them. Finding the largest independent set in an arbitrary graph is extremely hard; in fact, this is one of the canonical NP-hard problems we will study in Chapter 12. But in some special classes of graphs, we can find largest independent sets quickly. In particular, when the input graph is a tree with $n$ vertices, we can actually compute the largest independent set in $O ( n )$ time.",

However, as the next example shows, this is not always the most appropriate data structure to use. \nAn independent set in a graph is a subset of the vertices with no edges between them. Finding the largest independent set in an arbitrary graph is extremely hard; in fact, this is one of the canonical NP-hard problems we will study in Chapter 12. But in some special classes of graphs, we can find largest independent sets quickly. In particular, when the input graph is a tree with $n$ vertices, we can actually compute the largest independent set in $O ( n )$ time. \n\nSuppose we are given a tree $T$ . Without loss of generality, suppose $T$ is a rooted tree; that is, there is a special node in $T$ called the root, and all edges are implicitly directed away from this vertex. (If $T$ is an unrooted tree—a connected acyclic undirected graph—we can choose an arbitrary vertex as the root.) We call vertex $w$ a descendant of vertex $nu$ if the unique path from $w$ to the root includes $nu$ ; equivalently, the descendants of $nu$ are $nu$ itself and the descendants of the children of $nu$ . The subtree rooted at $nu$ consists of all the descendants of $nu$ and the edges between them. \nFor any node $nu$ in $T$ , let $M I S ( nu )$ denote the size of the largest independent set in the subtree rooted at $nu$ . Any independent set in this subtree that excludes $nu$ itself is the union of independent sets in the subtrees rooted at the children of $nu$ . On the other hand, any independent set that includes $nu$ necessarily excludes all of $nu ^ { prime } s$ children, and therefore includes independent sets in the subtrees rooted at v’s grandchildren. Thus, the function MIS obeys the following recurrence, where the nonstandard notation $w downarrow nu$ means ${ } ^ { mathfrak { s } } w$ is a child of $nu ^ { prime prime }$ : \nWe need to compute $M I S ( r )$ , where $r$ is the root of $T$ . \nWhat data structure should we use to memoize this recurrence? The most natural choice is the tree $T$ itself! Specifically, for each vertex $nu$ in $T$ , we store the result of $M I S ( nu )$ in a new field v. MIS. (In principle, we could use an array instead, but then we’d need pointers back and forth between each node and its corresponding array entry, so why bother?) \nWhat’s a good order to consider the subproblems? The subproblem associated with any node $nu$ depends on the subproblems associated with the children and grandchildren of $nu$ . So we can visit the nodes in any order we like, provided that every vertex is visited before its parent; in particular, we can use a standard post-order traversal. \nWhat’s the running time of the algorithm? The non-recursive time associated with each node $nu$ is proportional to the number of children and grandchildren of $nu$ ; this number can be very different from one vertex to the next. But we can turn the analysis around: Each vertex contributes a constant amount of time to its parent and its grandparent! Because each vertex has at most one parent and at most one grandparent, the algorithm runs in $O ( n )$ time. \n\nHere is the resulting dynamic programming algorithm. Yes, it’s still recursive, because that’s the most natural way to implement a post-order tree traversal. \nTreeMIS(v): skipv 0 for each child $w$ of $nu$ $s k i p nu gets s k i p nu + mathrm { T R E E M I S } ( w )$ $k e e p nu gets 1$ for each grandchild $x$ of $nu$ $k e e p nu gets k e e p nu + x . M I S$ $nu . M I S gets operatorname* { m a x } { k e e p nu , s k i p nu }$ return v. MIS \nWe can derive an even simpler linear-time algorithm by defining two separate functions over the nodes of $T$ : \n• Let $M I S y e s ( nu )$ denote the size of the largest independent set of the subtree rooted at $nu$ that includes $nu$ .   \n• Let $M I S n o ( nu )$ denote the size of the largest independent set of the subtree rooted at $nu$ that excludes $nu$ . \nAgain, we need to compute max ${ M I S y e s ( r ) , M I S n o ( r ) }$ , where $r$ is the root of $T$ . The first two functions satisfy the following mutual recurrence: \nAgain, we can memoize these functions into the tree itself, by defining two new fields for each vertex. A straightforward post-order tree traversal evaluates both functions at every node in $O ( n )$ time. The following algorithm not only memoizes both function values at $nu$ , it also returns the larger of those two values. \nIn the second line of the inner loop, we are using the value w. MISno that was memoized by the recursive call in the previous line. \nExercises \nFor all of the following exercises—and more generally when developing any new dynamic programming algorithm—I strongly recommend following the steps outlined in Section 3.4. In particular, don’t even start thinking about tables or for-loops until you have a complete recursive solution, including a clear English specification of the recursive subproblems you are actually solving.18 First make it work, then make it fast. \nSequences/Arrays \n1.

Describe efficient algorithms for the following variants of the text segmentation problem. Assume that you have a subroutine IsWord that takes an array of characters as input and returns True if and only if that string is a “word”. Analyze your algorithms by bounding the number of calls to IsWord. \n(a) Given an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of characters, compute the number of partitions of A into words. For example, given the string ARTISTOIL, your algorithm should return 2, for the partitions ARTIST $mathbf { nabla } cdot mathbf { mu }$ OIL and ART $cdot$ IS·TOIL.   \n(b) Given two arrays $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ and $B [ 1 ldots n ]$ of characters, decide whether $A$ and $B$ can be partitioned into words at the same indices. For example, the strings BOTHEARTHANDSATURNSPIN and PINSTARTRAPSANDRAGSLAP can be partitioned into words at the same indices as follows: \nBOT·HEART $cdot$ HAND·SAT·URNS·PIN PIN·START $cdot cdot$ RAPS·AND $mathbf { nabla } cdot mathbf { mu }$ RAGS·LAP \n(c) Given two arrays $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ and $B [ 1 ldots n ]$ of characters, compute the number of different ways that $A$ and $B$ can be partitioned into words at the same indices. \n3. Suppose you are given an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of numbers, which may be positive, negative, or zero, and which are not necessarily integers. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm that finds the largest sum of elements in a contiguous subarray $A [ i ldots j ]$ .   \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm that finds the largest product of elements in a contiguous subarray $A [ i . . j ]$ . \nFor example, given the array $[ - 6 , 1 2 , - 7 , 0 , 1 4 , - 7 , 5 ]$ as input, your first algorithm should return 19, and your second algorithm should return 504. \nGiven the one-element array $[ - 3 7 4 ]$ as input, your first algorithm should return 0, and your second algorithm should return 1.

You can find many correct solutions on the web; the problem even has its own Wikipedia page! But at least in 2016, a significant fraction of the solutions I found on the web for part (b) were either slower than necessary or actually incorrect.] \n4. This exercise explores variants of the maximum-subarray problem (Problem 3). In all cases, your input consists of an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of real numbers (which could be positive, negative, or zero) and possibly an additional integer $X geq 0$ . \n(a) Wrapping around: Suppose $A$ is a circular array. In this setting, a “contiguous subarray” can be either an interval $A [ i ldots j ]$ or a suffix followed by a prefix $A [ i dots n ] cdot A [ 1 dots j ]$ . Describe and analyze an algorithm that finds a contiguous subarray of $A$ with the largest sum.   \n(b) Long subarrays only: Describe and analyze an algorithm that finds a contiguous subarray of $A$ of length at least $X$ that has the largest sum. (Assume $X leq n$ .)   \n(c) Short subarrays only: Describe and analyze an algorithm that finds a contiguous subarray of $A$ of length at most $X$ that has the largest sum.   \n(d) The Price Is Right: Describe and analyze an algorithm that finds a contiguous subarray of $A$ with the largest sum less than or equal to $X$ .   \n(e) Describe a faster algorithm for Problem $4 ( mathrm { d } )$ when every number in the array $A$ is non-negative. \n5. This exercise asks you to develop efficient algorithms to find optimal subsequences of various kinds. A subsequence is anything obtained from a sequence by extracting a subset of elements, but keeping them in the same order; the elements of the subsequence need not be contiguous in the original sequence. For example, the strings C, DAMN, YAIOAI, and DYNAMICPROGRAMMING are all subsequences of the string DYNAMICPROGRAMMING. \n[Hint: Exactly one of these problems can be solved in $O ( n )$ time using a greedy algorithm.] \n(a) Let $A [ 1 ldots m ]$ and $B [ 1 ldots n ]$ be two arbitrary arrays. A common subsequence of $A$ and $B$ is another sequence that is a subsequence of both $A$ and $B$ . Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the longest common subsequence of $A$ and $B$ .   \n(b) Let $A [ 1 ldots m ]$ and $B [ 1 ldots n ]$ be two arbitrary arrays. A common supersequence of $A$ and $B$ is another sequence that contains both $A$ and $B$ as subsequences. Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the shortest common supersequence of $A$ and $B$ .   \n(c) Call a sequence $X [ 1 ldots n ]$ of numbers bitonic if there is an index i with $1 < i < n$ , such that the prefix $X [ 1 . . i ]$ is increasing and the suffix $X [ i ldots n ]$ is decreasing. Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the longest bitonic subsequence of an arbitrary array $A$ of integers.   \n(d) Call a sequence $X [ 1 ldots n ]$ of numbers oscillating if $X [ i ] < X [ i + 1 ]$ for all even $i$ , and $X [ i ] > X [ i + 1 ]$ for all odd $i$ . Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the longest oscillating subsequence of an arbitrary array $A$ of integers.   \n(e) Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the shortest oscillating supersequence of an arbitrary array $A$ of integers.   \n(f) Call a sequence $X [ 1 ldots n ]$ of numbers convex if $2 { cdot } X [ i ] < X [ i - 1 ] { + } X [ i { + } 1 ]$ for all $i$ . Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the longest convex subsequence of an arbitrary array $A$ of integers.   \n(g) Call a sequence $X [ 1 ldots n ]$ of numbers weakly increasing if each element is larger than the average of the two previous elements; that is, $2 cdot X [ i ] >$ $X [ i - 1 ] + X [ i - 2 ]$ for all $i > 2$ . Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the longest weakly increasing subsequence of an arbitrary array $A$ of integers.   \n(h) Call a sequence $X [ 1 ldots n ]$ of numbers double-increasing if $X [ i ] > X [ i - 2 ]$ for all $i > 2$ . (In other words, a double-increasing sequence is a perfect shuffle of two increasing sequences.) Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the longest double-increasing subsequence of an arbitrary array $A$ of integers.   \n(i) Recall that a sequence $X [ 1 ldots n ]$ of numbers is increasing if $X [ i ] < X [ i + 1 ]$ for all $i$ . Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the longest common increasing subsequence of two given arrays of integers. For example, $langle 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 rangle$ is the longest common increasing subsequence of the sequences $langle 3 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 5 , 9 , 2 , 6 , 5 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 7 , 9 , 3 rangle$ and $langle 1 , 4 , 1 , 4 , 2$ , $1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 3 , 0 , 9 , 5 rangle$ . \n\n6. A shuffle of two strings $X$ and $Y$ is formed by interspersing the characters into a new string, keeping the characters of $X$ and $Y$ in the same order. For example, the string BANANAANANAS is a shuffle of the strings BANANA and ANANAS in several different ways. \nBANANAANANAS BANANAANANAS BANANAANANAS \nSimilarly, the strings PRODGYRNAMAMMIINCG and DYPRONGARMAMMICING are both shuffles of DYNAMIC and PROGRAMMING: \nPRODGYRNAMAMMIINCG DYPRONGARMAMMICING \n(a) Given three strings $A [ 1 ldots m ] , B [ 1 ldots n ]$ , and $C [ 1 ldots m + n ]$ , describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether $C$ is a shuffle of $A$ and $B$ .   \n(b) A smooth shuffle of $X$ and $Y$ is a shuffle of $X$ and $Y$ that never uses more than two consecutive symbols of either string. For example,   \n• PRDOYGNARAMMMIICNG is a smooth shuffle of the strings DYNAMIC and PROGRAMMING.   \n• DYPRNOGRAAMMMICING is a shuffle of DYNAMIC and PROGRAMMING, but it is not a smooth shuffle (because of the substrings OGR and ING).   \n• XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a smooth shuffle of the strings XXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXX.   \n• There is no smooth shuffle of the strings XXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX. \n\nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to decide, given three strings $X , Y$ , and $Z$ , whether $Z$ is a smooth shuffle of $X$ and $Y$ . \n7. For each of the following problems, the input consists of two arrays $X [ 1 . . k ]$ and $Y [ 1 . . n ]$ where $k leq n$ . \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to decide whether $X$ is a subsequence of $Y$ . For example, the string PPAP is a subsequence of the string PENPINEAPPLEAPPLEPEN.   \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the smallest number of symbols that can be removed from $Y$ so that $X$ is no longer a subsequence. Equivalently, your algorithm should find the longest subsequence of $Y$ that is not a supersequence of $X$ . For example, after removing removing two symbols from the string PENPINEAPPLEAPPLEPEN, the string PPAP is no longer a subsequence.   \nn(c) Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether $X$ occurs as two disjoint subsequences of Y . For example, the string PPAP appears as two disjoint subsequences in the string PENPINEAPPLEAPPLEPEN.   \n(d) Suppose the input also includes a third array $C [ 1 . . n ]$ of numbers, which may be positive, negative, or zero, where $C [ i ]$ is the cost of $Y [ i ]$ . Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum-cost occurrence of $X$ as a subsequence of Y . That is, we want to find an array $I [ 1 ldots k ]$ such that $I [ j ] < I [ j + 1 ]$ and $X [ I [ j ] ] = Y [ j ]$ for every index $j$ , and the total cost $textstyle sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { k } C [ j ]$ is as small as possible.   \n(e) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the total number of (possibly overlapping) occurrences of $X$ as a subsequence of $Y$ . For purposes of analysis, assume that we can add two arbitrary integers in $O ( 1 )$ time. For example, the string PPAP appears exactly 23 times as a subsequence of the string PENPINEAPPLEAPPLEPEN. If all characters in $X$ and $Y$ are equal, your algorithm should return $textstyle { binom { n } { k } }$ .   \n(f) What is the running time of your algorithm for part (d) if adding two $ell$ -bit integers requires $O ( ell )$ time? \n8. Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to find the length of the longest contiguous substring that appears both forward and backward in an input string $T [ 1 . . n ]$ . The forward and backward substrings must not overlap. Here are several examples: \n• Given the input string ALGORITHM, your algorithm should return 0.   \n• Given the input string RECURSION, your algorithm should return 1, for the substring R.   \n• Given the input string REDIVIDE, your algorithm should return 3, for the substring EDI. (The forward and backward substrings must not overlap!)   \n• Given the input string DYNAMICPROGRAMMINGMANYTIMES, your algorithm should return 4, for the substring YNAM. (In particular, it should not return 6, for the subsequence YNAMIR). \n9. A palindrome is any string that is exactly the same as its reversal, like I, or DEED, or RACECAR, or AMANAPLANACATACANALPANAMA. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given string that is also a palindrome. For example, the longest palindrome subsequence of the string MAHDYNAMICPROGRAMZLETMESHOWYOUTHEM is MHYMRORMYHM; thus, given that string as input, your algorithm should return 11.   \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the length of the shortest supersequence of a given string that is also a palindrome. For example, the shortest palindrome supersequence of TWENTYONE is TWENTOYOTNEWT, so given the string TWENTYONE as input, your algorithm should return 13.   \n(c) Any string can be decomposed into a sequence of palindromes. For example, the string BUBBASEESABANANA (“Bubba sees a banana.”) can be broken into palindromes in the following ways (and 65 others): \nDescribe and analyze an efficient algorithm to find the smallest number of palindromes that make up a given input string. For example, given the input string BUBBASEESABANANA, your algorithm should return 3. \n(d) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to find the largest integer $k$ such that a given string can be split into palindromes of length at least $k$ . For example: \n• Given the string PALINDROME, your algorithm should return 1. • Given the string BUBBASEESABANANA, your algorithm should return 3, for the partition BUB • BASEESAB • ANANA. • Given a string of $n$ identical symbols, your algorithm should return n. \n(e) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to find the number of different ways that a given string can be decomposed into palindromes. For example: \n• Given the string PALINDROME, your algorithm should return 1.   \n• Given the string BUBBASEESABANANA, your algorithm should return 70.   \n• Given a string of $n$ identical symbols, your algorithm should return 2n−1. \nn(f) A metapalindrome is a decomposition of a string into a sequence of palindromes, such that the sequence of palindrome lengths is itself a palindrome. For example: \nis a metapalindrome for the string BOBSMAMASEESAUKULELE, whose length sequence is the palindrome $( 3 , 1 , 3 , 6 , 3 , 1 , 3 )$ . Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to find the length of the shortest metapalindrome for a given string. For example, given the input string BOBSMAMASEESAUKULELE, your algorithm should return 11. \n10. Suppose you are given an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of positive integers. An increasing back-and-forth subsequence is an sequence of indices $I [ 1 ldots ell ]$ with the following properties: \n• $1 leq I [ j ] leq n$ for all $j$ .   \n• $A [ I [ j ] ] < A [ I [ j + 1 ] ]$ for all $j < ell$ .   \n• If $I [ j ]$ is even, then $I [ j + 1 ] > I [ j ]$ .   \n• If $I [ j ]$ is odd, then $I [ j + 1 ] < I [ j ]$ . \nLess formally, suppose we are given an array of $n$ squares, each containing a positive integer. Suppose we place a token on one of the squares, and then repeatedly move the token left (if it’s on an odd-indexed square) or right (if it’s on an even-indexed square), always moving from a smaller number to a larger number. Then the sequence of token positions is an increasing back-and-forth subsequence. \nDescribe an algorithm to compute the length of the longest increasing back-and-forth subsequence of a given array of $n$ integers. For example, given the input array \nyour algorithm should return the integer 9, which is the length of the following increasing back-and-forth subsequence: \n11. Suppose we want to typeset a paragraph of text onto a piece of paper (or if you insist, a computer screen). The text consists of a sequence of n words, where the ith word has length $ell [ i ]$ . We want to break the paragraph into several lines of total length exactly $L$ . For example, according to $mathrm { T } _ { mathrm { E } } mathrm { X } .$ , the program used to typeset these notes, the paragraph you are reading right now is approximately $1 1 . 9 4 7 9 4 mathrm { c m } approx 4 . 7 0 5 5$ inches wide. \nDepending on how the paragraph is broken into lines of text, we must insert different amounts of white space between the words. The paragraph should be fully justified, meaning that the first character on each line starts at the left margin, and except for the last line, the last character on each line ends at the right margin. There must be at least one unit of white space between any two words on the same line. See the paragraph you are reading right now? Just like that. \nDefine the slop of a paragraph layout as the sum over all lines, except the last, of the cube of the amount of extra white-space in each line, not counting the one unit of required space between each adjacent pair of words. Specifically, if a line contains words $i$ through $j$ , then the slop of that line is defined to be $begin{array} { r } { left( L - j + i - sum _ { k = i } ^ { j } ell [ k ] right) ^ { 3 } } end{array}$ . Describe a dynamic programming algorithm to print the paragraph with minimum slop. \n12. You and your eight-year-old nephew Elmo decide to play a simple card game. At the beginning of the game, the cards are dealt face up in a long row. Each card is worth a different number of points. After all the cards are dealt, you and Elmo take turns removing either the leftmost or rightmost card from the row, until all the cards are gone. At each turn, you can decide which of the two cards to take. The winner of the game is the player that has collected the most points when the game ends. \nHaving never taken an algorithms class, Elmo follows the obvious greedy strategy—when it’s his turn, Elmo always takes the card with the higher point value. Your task is to find a strategy that will beat Elmo whenever possible. (It might seem mean to beat up on a little kid like this, but Elmo absolutely hates it when grown-ups let him win.) \n(a) Prove that you should not also use the greedy strategy. That is, show that there is a game that you can win, but only if you do not follow the same greedy strategy as Elmo. \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine, given the initial sequence of cards, the maximum number of points that you can collect playing against Elmo.   \np(c) When Elmo was four, he used an even simpler strategy—on his turn, he always chose his next card uniformly at random. That is, if there was more than one card left on his turn, he would take the leftmost card with probability $1 / 2$ , and the rightmost card with probability $1 / 2$ . Describe an algorithm to determine, given the initial sequence of cards, the maximum expected number of points you can collect playing against four-year-old-Elmo.   \n(d) Five years later, thirteen-year-old Elmo has become a much stronger player. Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine, given the initial sequence of cards, the maximum number of points that you can collect playing against a perfect opponent. \n13. It’s almost time to show off your flippin’ sweet dancing skills! Tomorrow is the big dance contest you’ve been training for your entire life, except for that summer you spent with your uncle in Alaska hunting wolverines. You’ve obtained an advance copy of the list of $n$ songs that the judges will play during the contest, in chronological order. Yessssssssss! \nYou know all the songs, all the judges, and your own dancing ability extremely well. For each integer $k$ , you know that if you dance to the kth song on the schedule, you will be awarded exactly $S c o r e [ k ]$ points, but then you will be physically unable to dance for the next $W a i t [ k ]$ songs (that is, you cannot dance to songs $k + 1$ through $k + W a i t [ k ] )$ . The dancer with the highest total score at the end of the night wins the contest, so you want your total score to be as high as possible. \nDescribe and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum total score you can achieve. The input to your sweet algorithm is the pair of arrays $S c o r e [ 1 ldots n ]$ and $W a i t [ 1 ldots n ]$ . \n14. The new swap-puzzle game Candy Swap Saga XIII involves n cute animals numbered from 1 to $n$ . Each animal holds one of three types of candy: circus peanuts, Heath bars, and Cioccolateria Gardini chocolate truffles. You also have a candy in your hand; at the start of the game, you have a circus peanut. \nTo earn points, you visit each of the animals in order from 1 to n. For each animal, you can either keep the candy in your hand or exchange it with the candy the animal is holding. \n• If you swap your candy for another candy of the same type, you earn one point. \n• If you swap your candy for a candy of a different type, you lose one point. (Yes, your score can be negative.)   \n• If you visit an animal and decide not to swap candy, your score does not change. \nYou must visit the animals in order, and once you visit an animal, you can never visit it again. \nDescribe and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute your maximum possible score. Your input is an array $C [ 1 . . n ]$ , where $C [ i ]$ is the type of candy that the ith animal is holding. \n15. Lenny Rutenbar, the founding dean of the new Maksymilian R. Levchin College of Computer Science, has commissioned a series of snow ramps on the south slope of the Orchard Downs sledding $mathrm {  h i l l { } } ^ { 2 0 }$ and challenged Bill Kudeki, head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, to a sledding contest. Bill and Lenny will both sled down the hill, each trying to maximize their air time. The winner gets to expand their department/college into both Siebel Center and the new ECE Building; the loser has to move their entire department/college in the Boneyard culvert next to Loomis Lab. \nWhenever Lenny or Bill reaches a ramp while on the ground, they can either use that ramp to jump through the air, possibly flying over one or more ramps, or sled past that ramp and stay on the ground. Obviously, if someone flies over a ramp, they cannot use that ramp to extend their jump. \n(a) Suppose you are given a pair of arrays $R a m p [ 1 ldots n ]$ and Length[1 .. n], where Ramp[i] is the distance from the top of the hill to the ith ramp, and Length[i] is the distance that any sledder who takes the ith ramp will travel through the air. Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine the maximum total distance that Lenny or Bill can spend in the air.   \n(b) The university lawyers heard about Lenny and Bill’s little bet and immediately objected. To protect the university from either lawsuits or sky-rocketing insurance rates, they impose an upper bound on the number of jumps that either sledder can take. Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine the maximum total distance that Lenny or Bill can spend in the air with at most $k$ jumps, given the original arrays $R a m p [ 1 ldots n ]$ and Length $left[ 1 ldots n right]$ and the integer $k$ as input.   \nn(c) When the lawyers realized that imposing their restriction didn’t immediately shut down the contest, they added a new restriction: No ramp can be used more than once! Disgusted by the legal interference, Lenny and Bill give up on their bet and decide to cooperate to put on a good show \nfor the spectators. Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine the maximum total distance that Lenny and Bill can spend in the air, each taking at most $k$ jumps (so at most $2 k$ jumps total), and with each ramp used at most once. \n16. Farmers Boggis, Bunce, and Bean have set up an obstacle course for Mr. Fox. The course consists of a long row of booths, each with a number painted on the front with bright red paint. Formally, Mr. Fox is given an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ , where A[i] is the number painted on the front of the ith booth. Each number $boldsymbol { A } [ i ]$ could be positive, negative, or zero. Everyone agrees with the following rules: \n• At each booth, Mr. Fox must say either “Ring!” or “Ding!”.   \n• If Mr. Fox says “Ring!” at the ith booth, he earns a reward of A[i] chickens. $( mathrm { I f } A [ i ] < 0$ , Mr. Fox pays a penalty of $- A [ i ]$ chickens.)   \n• If Mr. Fox says “Ding!” at the ith booth, he pays a penalty of $A [ i ]$ chickens. $( mathrm { I f } A [ i ] < 0$ , Mr. Fox earns a reward of $- A [ i ]$ chickens.)   \n• Mr. Fox is forbidden to say the same word more than three times in a row. For example, if he says “Ring!” at booths 6, 7, and 8, then he must say “Ding!” at booth 9.   \n• All accounts will be settled at the end, after Mr. Fox visits every booth and the umpire calls “Hot box!” Mr. Fox does not actually have to carry chickens through the obstacle course.   \n• Finally, if Mr. Fox violates any of the rules, or if he ends the obstacle course owing the farmers chickens, the farmers will shoot him. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to compute, the largest number of chickens that Mr. Fox can earn by running the obstacle course, given the array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of numbers as input. [Hint: Watch out for the burning pine cone!] \n17. Dance Dance Revolution is a dance video game, first introduced in Japan by Konami in 1998. Players stand on a platform marked with four arrows, pointing forward, back, left, and right, arranged in a cross pattern. During play, the game plays a song and scrolls a sequence of $n$ arrows $( Leftarrow , uparrow , downarrow ,$ or $$ ) from the bottom to the top of the screen. At the precise moment each arrow reaches the top of the screen, the player must step on the corresponding arrow on the dance platform. (The arrows are timed so that you’ll step with the beat of the song.) \nYou are playing a variant of this game called “Vogue Vogue Revolution”, where the goal is to play perfectly but move as little as possible. When an arrow reaches the top of the screen, if one of your feet is already on the correct arrow, you are awarded one style point for maintaining your current pose. If neither foot is on the right arrow, you must move one (and only one) foot from its current location to the correct arrow on the platform. If you ever step on the wrong arrow, or fail to step on the correct arrow, or move more than one foot at a time, or move either foot when you are already standing on the correct arrow, all your style points are taken away and you lose the game. \n\nHow should you move your feet to maximize your total number of style points? For purposes of this problem, assume you always start with your left foot on $$ and your right foot on $$ , and that you’ve memorized the entire sequence of arrows. For example, if the sequence is $uparrow uparrow downarrow downarrow left. right. left. right.$ , you can earn 5 style points by moving your feet as shown below: \n(a) Prove that for any sequence of $n$ arrows, it is possible to earn at least $n / 4 - 1$ style points.   \n(b) Describe an efficient algorithm to find the maximum number of style points you can earn during a given VVR routine. The input to your algorithm is an array Arrow[1 .. n] containing the sequence of arrows. \n18. Consider the following solitaire form of Scrabble. We begin with a fixed, finite sequence of tiles; each tile has both a letter and a numerical value. At the start of the game, we draw the first seven tiles from the sequence and put them into our hand. In each turn, we form an English word from some or all of the tiles in our hand, place those tiles on the table, and receive the total value of those tiles as points. (If no English word can be formed from the tiles in our hand, the game immediately ends.) Then we repeatedly draw the next tile from the start of the sequence until either (a) we have seven tiles in our hand, or (b) the sequence is empty. (Sorry, no double/triple word/letter scores, bingos, blanks, or passing.) Our goal is to obtain as many points as possible. \nFor example, consider the following sequence of 20 tiles: \nGiven this sequence of tiles at the beginning of the game, we can earn 68 points as follows: \n• We initially draw I2 N2 X8 A1 N2 A1 • Play the word N A1 I A1 D3 for 9 points, leaving $boxed { N _ { 2 } } boxed { times _ { 8 } }$ in hand. \n• Draw the next five tiles U5 D3 I2 D3 • Play the word $leftlceil bigcup _ { 5 } rightrceil leftlceil  N _ { 2 } rightrceil leftlceil  mathbb { D } _ { 3 } rightrceil leftlceil  mathbb { I } _ { 2 } rightrceil leftlceil  mathbb { D } _ { 3 } rightrceil$ for 15 points, leaving $boxed { mathsf { K } _ { 8 } } boxed { mathsf { X } _ { 8 } }$ in hand. • Draw the next five tiles $begin{array} { r } { boxed { mathsf { U } _ { 5 } } boxed { mathsf { B } _ { 4 } } boxed { mathsf { L } _ { 2 } } boxed { mathsf { A } _ { 1 } } boxed { mathsf { K } _ { 8 } } . } end{array}$ • Play the word $boxed { mathrm { B } _ { 4 } } boxed { mathrm { U } _ { 5 } } boxed { mathrm { L } _ { 2 } } boxed { mathrm { K } _ { 8 } }$ for 19 points, leaving $boxed {  K _ { 8 } } boxed { times _ { 8 } } boxed { textsc { A } _ { 1 } }$ in hand. • Draw the last three tiles $begin{array} { r } { boxed { mathsf { H } _ { 5 } } boxed { mathsf { A } _ { 1 } } boxed { mathsf { N } _ { 2 } } , } end{array}$ • Play the word $boxed { mathsf { A } _ { 1 } } boxed { mathsf { N } _ { 2 } } boxed { mathsf { K } _ { 8 } } boxed { mathsf { H } _ { 5 } }$ for 16 points, leaving $boxed {  X _ { 8 } } boxed {  A _ { 1 } }$ in hand. • Play the word $boxed { textsc { A 1 } } boxed { times _ { 8 } }$ for 9 points, emptying our hand and ending the game.   \n(a) Suppose the sequence of tiles is represented by two arrays Letter[1 .. n], containing a sequence of letters between A and Z, and Value[A .. Z], where $V a l u e [ ell ]$ is the value of any tile with letter $ell$ . Design and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum number of points that can be earned from the given sequence of tiles.   \n(b) Now suppose two tiles with the same letter might have different values. Now the tile sequence is represented by two arrays Letter[1 .. n] and $V a l u e [ 1 ldots n ]$ , where Value[i] is the value of the ith tile. Design and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum number of points that can be earned from the given sequence of tiles. \nIn both problems, the output is a single number: the maximum possible score. Assume (because it’s true) that you can find all English words that can be made from any set of at most seven tiles, along with the point values of those words, in $O ( 1 )$ time. \n19. Suppose we are given a set $L$ of $n$ line segments in the plane, where each segment has one endpoint on the line $y = 0$ and one endpoint on the line $y = 1$ , and all $2 n$ endpoints are distinct. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the largest subset of $L$ in which no pair of segments intersects.   \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the largest subset of $L$ in which every pair of segments intersects. \nNow suppose we are given a set $L$ of $n$ line segments in the plane, where both endpoints of each segment lie on the unit circle $x ^ { 2 } + y ^ { 2 } = 1$ , and all $2 n$ endpoints are distinct. \n(c) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the largest subset of $L$ in which no pair of segments intersects.   \n(d) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the largest subset of $L$ in which every pair of segments intersects. \n20. Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points evenly distributed on the unit circle, and let $s$ be a set of $m$ line segments with endpoints in $P$ . The endpoints of the $m$ segments are not necessarily distinct; $n$ could be significantly smaller than $2 m$ . \n(a) Describe an algorithm to find the size of the largest subset of segments in $s$ such that every pair is disjoint. Two segments are disjoint if they do not intersect even at their endpoints.   \n(b) Describe an algorithm to find the size of the largest subset of segments in $s$ such that every pair is interior-disjoint. Two segments are interiordisjoint if their intersection is either empty or an endpoint of both segments.   \n(c) Describe an algorithm to find the size of the largest subset of segments in $s$ such that every pair intersects.   \n(d) Describe an algorithm to find the size of the largest subset of segments in $s$ such that every pair crosses. Two segments cross if they intersect but not at their endpoints. \nFor full credit, all four algorithms should run in $O ( m n )$ time. \n21. You are driving a bus along a highway, full of rowdy, hyper, thirsty students and a soda fountain machine. Each minute that a student is on your bus, that student drinks one ounce of soda. Your goal is to drop the students off quickly, so that the total amount of soda consumed by all students is as small as possible. \nYou know how many students will get off of the bus at each exit. Your bus begins somewhere along the highway (probably not at either end) and moves at a constant speed of 37.4 miles per hour. You must drive the bus along the highway; however, you may drive forward to one exit then backward to an exit in the opposite direction, switching as often as you like. (You can stop the bus, drop off students, and turn around instantaneously.) \nDescribe an efficient algorithm to drop the students off so that they drink as little soda as possible. Your input consists of the bus route (a list of the exits, together with the travel time between successive exits), the number of students you will drop off at each exit, and the current location of your bus (which you may assume is an exit). \n22. Let’s define a summary of two strings $A$ and $B$ to be a concatenation of substrings of the following form: \n▲SNA indicates a substring SNA of only the first string A.   \nFOO indicates a common substring FOO of both strings.   \n▼BAR indicates a substring BAR of only the second string $B$ . \nA summary is valid if we can recover the original strings $A$ and $B$ by concatenating the appropriate substrings of the summary in order and discarding the delimiters ▲, $bullet$ , and $blacktriangledown$ . Each regular character has length 1, and each delimiter ▲, $bullet$ , or $blacktriangledown$ has some fixed non-negative length $triangle$ . The length of a summary is the sum of the lengths of its symbols. \nFor example, each of the following strings is a valid summary of the strings KITTEN and KNITTING: \nK▼NITT▲E▼IN▼G has length $9 + 7 Delta$ .   \nK▼NITT▲EN▼ING has length $1 0 + 5 Delta$ .   \nK▲ITTEN▼NITTING has length $1 3 + 3 Delta$ .   \n▲KITTEN▼KNITTING has length $1 4 + 2 Delta$ . \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm that computes the length of the shortest summary of two given strings $A [ 1 ldots m ]$ and $B [ 1 ldots n ]$ . The delimiter length $Delta$ is also part of the input to your algorithm. For example: \n• Given strings KITTEN and KNITTING and $Delta = 0$ , your algorithm should return 9.   \n• Given strings KITTEN and KNITTING and $Delta = 1$ , your algorithm should return 15.   \n• Given strings KITTEN and KNITTING and $Delta = 2$ , your algorithm should return 18. \n23. Vankin’s Mile is an American solitaire game played on an $n times n$ square grid. The player starts by placing a token on any square of the grid. Then on each turn, the player moves the token either one square to the right or one square down. The game ends when player moves the token off the edge of the board. Each square of the grid has a numerical value, which could be positive, negative, or zero. The player starts with a score of zero; whenever the token lands on a square, the player adds its value to his score. The object of the game is to score as many points as possible. \nFor example, given the grid below, the player can score $8 - 6 + 7 - 3 + 4 =$ 10 points by placing the initial token on the 8 in the second row, and then moving down, down, right, down, down. (This is not the best possible score for this grid of numbers.) \n(a) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum possible score for a game of Vankin’s Mile, given the $n times n$ array of values as input.   \n(b) In the European version of this game, appropriately called Vankin’s Kilometer, the player can move the token either one square down, one square right, or one square left in each turn. However, to prevent infinite scores, the token cannot land on the same square more than once. Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum possible score for a game of Vankin’s Kilometer, given the $n times n$ array of values as input.21 \n24. Suppose you are given an $m times n$ bitmap as an array $M [ 1 dots n , 1 dots n ]$ of 0s and 1s. A solid block in $M$ is a subarray of the form $M [ i ldots i ^ { prime } , j ldots j ^ { prime } ]$ in which all bits are equal. A solid block is square if it has the same number of rows and columns. \n(a) Describe an algorithm to find the maximum area of a solid square block in $M$ in $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time.   \n(b) Describe an algorithm to find the maximum area of a solid block in $M$ in $O ( n ^ { 3 } )$ time.   \n(c) Describe an algorithm to find the maximum area of a solid block in M in $O ( n ^ { 2 } log { n } )$ time. [Hint: Divide and conquer.]   \nn(d) Describe an algorithm to find the maximum area of a solid block in M in $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time. \n25. Suppose you are given an array $M [ 1 ldots n , 1 ldots n ]$ of numbers, which may be positive, negative, or zero, and which are not necessarily integers. Describe an algorithm to find the largest sum of elements in any rectangular subarray of the form $M [ i ldots i ^ { prime } , j ldots j ^ { prime } ]$ . For full credit, your algorithm should run in $O ( n ^ { 3 } )$ time. [Hint: See problem 3.] \n26. Describe and analyze an algorithm that finds the maximum-area rectangular pattern that appears more than once in a given bitmap. Specifically, given a two-dimensional array $M [ 1 ldots n , 1 ldots n ]$ of bits as input, your algorithm should output the area of the largest repeated rectangular pattern in $M$ . For example, given the bitmap shown on the left in the figure below, your algorithm should return the integer 195, which is the area of the $1 5 times 1 3$ doggo. (Although it doesn’t happen in this example, the two copies of the repeated pattern might overlap.) \n(a) For full credit, describe an algorithm that runs in $O ( n ^ { 5 } )$ time. $ { mathrm { ~  ~ omega ~ } } ( {  { mathbf { b } } } )$ For extra credit, describe an algorithm that runs in $O ( n ^ { 4 } )$ time. $triangleq left( mathrm { c } right)$ For extra extra credit, describe an algorithm that runs in $O ( n ^ { 3 } mathrm { p o l y l o g } n )$ time. \n27. Let $P$ be a set of points in the plane in convex position. Intuitively, if a rubber band were wrapped around the points, then every point would touch the rubber band. More formally, for any point $p$ in $P$ , there is a line that separates $p$ from the other points in $P$ . Moreover, suppose the points are indexed $P [ 1 ] , P [ 2 ] , ldots , P [ n ]$ in counterclockwise order around the “rubber band”, starting with the leftmost point $P [ 1 ]$ . \nThis problem asks you to solve a special case of the traveling salesman problem, where the salesman must visit every point in $P$ , and the cost of moving from one point $p in P$ to another point $q in P$ is the Euclidean distance $| p q |$ . \n(a) Describe a simple algorithm to compute the shortest cyclic tour of $P$ .   \n(b) A simple tour is one that never crosses itself. Prove that the shortest tour of $P$ must be simple.   \n(c) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute the shortest tour of $P$ that starts at the leftmost point $P [ 1 ]$ and ends at the rightmost point $P [ r ]$ .   \n(d) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute the shortest tour of $P$ , with no restrictions on the endpoints. \n$2 8$ . Describe and analyze an algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem in $O ( 2 ^ { n } mathrm { p o l y } ( n ) )$ time. Given an undirected $n$ -vertex graph $G$ with weighted edges, your algorithm should return the weight of the lightest cycle in $G$ that visits every vertex exactly once, or $infty$ if $G$ has no such cycles. [Hint: The obvious recursive backtracking algorithm takes $O ( n ! )$ time.] \n29. Let $W = { w _ { 1 } , w _ { 2 } , ldots , w _ { n } }$ be a finite set of strings over some fixed alphabet $Sigma$ . An edit center for $W$ is a string $C in Sigma ^ { * }$ such that the maximum edit distance from $C$ to any string in $W$ is as small as possible. The edit radius of $W$ is the maximum edit distance from an edit center to a string in $W$ . A set of strings may have several edit centers, but its edit radius is unique. \n\n(a) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute the edit radius of three given strings. $triangleq ( boldsymbol { mathrm { b } } )$ Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to approximate the edit radius of an arbitrary set of strings within a factor of 2. (Computing the exact edit radius is NP-hard unless the number of strings is fixed.) \n$pmb { nu } _ { 3 0 }$ . Let $D [ 1 ldots n ]$ be an array of digits, each an integer between 0 and 9. A digital subsequence of $D$ is a sequence of positive integers composed in the usual way from disjoint substrings of $D$ . For example, the sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 32, 38, 46, 64, 83, 279 is a digital subsequence of the first several digits of $pi$ : \nThe length of a digital subsequence is the number of integers it contains, not the number of digits; the preceding example has length 12. As usual, a digital subsequence is increasing if each number is larger than its predecessor. \nDescribe and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute the longest increasing digital subsequence of $D$ . [Hint: Be careful about your computational assumptions. How long does it take to compare two $k$ -digit numbers?] \nFor full credit, your algorithm should run in $O ( n ^ { 4 } )$ time; faster algorithms are worth extra credit. The fastest algorithm I know for this problem runs in $O ( n ^ { 3 / 2 } log n )$ time; achieving this bound requires several tricks, both in the design of the algorithm and in its analysis, but nothing outside the scope of this class.22 \n$pmb { nu } _ { 3 1 }$ . Consider the following variant of the classical Tower of Hanoi problem. As usual, there are $n$ disks with distinct sizes, placed on three pegs numbered 0, 1, and 2. Initially, all $n$ disks are on peg 0, sorted by size from smallest on top to largest on bottom. Our goal is to move all the disks to peg 2. In a single step, we can move the highest disk on any peg to a different peg, provided we satisfy two constraints. First, we must never place a smaller disk on top of a larger disk. Second—and this is the non-standard part—we must never move a disk directly from peg 0 to peg 2. \n\nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to compute the exact number of moves required to move all $n$ disks from peg 0 to peg 2, subject to the stated restrictions. For full credit, your algorithm should use only $O ( log n )$ arithmetic operations in the worst case. For the sake of analysis, assume that adding or multiplying two $k$ -digit numbers requires $O ( k )$ time. [Hint: Matrices!] \nSplitting Sequences/Arrays \n32. A basic arithmetic expression is composed of characters from the set ${ 1 , + , times }$ and parentheses. Almost every integer can be represented by more than one basic arithmetic expression. For example, all of the following basic arithmetic expression represent the integer 14: \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to compute, given an integer $n$ as input, the minimum number of 1s in a basic arithmetic expression whose value is equal to $n$ . The number of parentheses doesn’t matter, just the number of 1s. For example, when $n = 1 4$ , your algorithm should return 8, for the final expression above. The running time of your algorithm should be bounded by a small polynomial function of $n$ . \n33. Suppose you are given a sequence of integers separated by $+$ and signs; for example: \nYou can change the value of this expression by adding parentheses in different places. For example: \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to compute, given a list of integers separated by $^ +$ and signs, the maximum possible value the expression \ncan take by adding parentheses. Parentheses must be used only to group additions and subtractions; in particular, do not use them to create implicit multiplication as in $1 + 3 ( - 2 ) ( - 5 ) + 1 - 6 + 7 = 3 3 $ \n34. Suppose you are given a sequence of integers separated by $+$ and $times$ signs; for example: \nYou can change the value of this expression by adding parentheses in different places. For example: \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the maximum possible value the given expression can take by adding parentheses, assuming all integers in the input are positive. [Hint: This is easy.]   \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the maximum possible value the given expression can take by adding parentheses, assuming all integers in the input are non-negative.   \n(c) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the maximum possible value the given expression can take by adding parentheses, with no restrictions on the input numbers. \nAssume any arithmetic operation takes O(1) time. \n35. After graduating from Sham-Poobanana University, you decide to interview for a position at the Wall Street bank Long Live Boole. The managing director of the bank, Eloob Egroeg, poses a ’solve-or-die’ problems to each new employee, which they must solve within 24 hours. Those who fail to solve the problem are fired immediately! \nEntering the bank for the first time, you notice that the employee offices are organized in a straight row, with a large $T$ or $F$ printed on the door of each office. Furthermore, between each adjacent pair of offices, there is a board marked by one of the symbols $wedge , vee$ , or $oplus$ . When you ask about these arcane symbols, Eloob confirms that $T$ and $F$ represent the boolean values True and False, and the symbols on the boards represent the standard boolean operators And, Or, and Xor. He also explains that these letters and symbols describe whether certain combinations of employees can work together successfully. At the start of any new project, Eloob hierarchically clusters his employees by adding parentheses to the sequence of symbols, to obtain an unambiguous boolean expression. The project is successful if this parenthesized boolean expression evaluates to $T$ . \n\nFor example, if the bank has three employees, and the sequence of symbols on and between their doors is $T wedge F oplus T$ , there is exactly one successful parenthesization scheme: $( T land ( F oplus T ) )$ ). However, if the list of door symbols is $F wedge T oplus F$ , there is no way to add parentheses to make the project successful. \nEloob finally poses your solve-or-die interview question: Describe an algorithm to decide whether a given sequence of symbols can be parenthesized so that the resulting boolean expression evaluates to $T$ . Your input is an array $S [ 0 ldots 2 n ]$ , where $S [ i ] in { T , F }$ when $i$ is even, and $S [ i ] in { lor , land , oplus }$ when $i$ is odd. \n36. Every year, as part of its annual meeting, the Antarctican Snail Lovers of Upper Glacierville hold a Round Table Mating Race. Several high-quality breeding snails are placed at the edge of a round table. The snails are numbered in order around the table from 1 to n. During the race, each snail wanders around the table, leaving a trail of slime behind it. The snails have been specially trained never to fall off the edge of the table or to cross a slime trail, even their own. If two snails meet, they are declared a breeding pair, removed from the table, and whisked away to a romantic hole in the ground to make little baby snails. Note that some snails may never find a mate, even if the race goes on forever. \nFor every pair of snails, the Antarctican SLUG race organizers have posted a monetary reward, to be paid to the owners if that pair of snails meets during the Mating Race. Specifically, there is a two-dimensional array $M [ 1 dots n , 1 dots n ]$ posted on the wall behind the Round Table, where $M [ i , j ] = M [ j , i ]$ is the reward to be paid if snails $i$ and $j$ meet. \n\nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to compute the maximum total reward that the organizers could be forced to pay, given the array $M$ as input. \n37. You have mined a large slab of marble from a quarry. For simplicity, suppose the marble slab is a rectangle measuring $n$ inches in height and $m$ inches in width. You want to cut the slab into smaller rectangles of various sizes— some for kitchen counter tops, some for large sculpture projects, others for memorial headstones. You have a marble saw that can make either horizontal or vertical cuts across any rectangular slab. At any time, you can query the spot price $P [ x , y ]$ of an $x$ -inch by $y$ -inch marble rectangle, for any positive integers $x$ and $y$ . These prices depend on customer demand, and people who buy marble counter tops are weird, so don’t make any assumptions about them; in particular, larger rectangles may have significantly smaller spot prices. Given the array of spot prices and the integers $m$ and $n$ as input, describe an algorithm to compute how to subdivide an $n times m$ marble slab to maximize your profit. \n38. This problem asks you to design efficient algorithms to construct optimal binary search trees that satisfy additional balance constraints. Your input consists of a sorted array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of search keys and an array $f [ 1 . . n ]$ of frequency counts, where $f [ i ]$ is the number of searches for $A [ i ]$ . This is exactly the same cost function as described in Section 3.9. But now your task is to compute an optimal tree that satisfies some additional constraints. \n(a) AVL trees were the earliest self-balancing balanced binary search trees, first described in 1962 by Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis. An AVL tree is a binary search tree where for every node $nu$ , the height of the left subtree of $nu$ and the height of the right subtree of $nu$ differ by at most one. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to construct an optimal AVL tree for a given set of search keys and frequencies. \n(b) Symmetric binary $B$ -trees are another self-balancing binary trees, first described by Rudolf Bayer in 1972; these are better known by the name red-black trees, after a somewhat simpler reformulation by Leo Guibas and Bob Sedgwick in 1978. A red-black tree is a binary search tree with the following additional constraints: \n• Every node is either red or black.   \n• Every red node has a black parent.   \n• Every root-to-leaf path contains the same number of black nodes. \nDescribe a recursive backtracking algorithm to construct an optimal red-black tree for a given set of search keys and frequencies. \n(c) AA trees were proposed by proposed by Arne Andersson in 1993 and slightly simplified (and named) by Mark Allen Weiss in 2000. AA trees are also known as left-leaning red-black trees, after a symmetric reformulation (with different rebalancing algorithms) by Bob Sedgewick in 2006. An AA tree is a red-black tree with one additional constraint: \n• No left child is red.23 \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to construct an optimal AA tree for a given set of search keys and frequencies. \n39. Suppose you are given an $m times n$ bitmap as an array $M [ 1 ldots m , 1 ldots n ]$ of 0s and 1s. A solid block in $M$ is a subarray of the form $M [ i dots i ^ { prime } , j dots i ^ { prime } ]$ in which all bits are equal. Suppose you want to decompose $M$ into as few disjoint blocks as possible. \nOne natural recursive partitioning strategy is called a guillotine subdivision. If the entire bitmap $M$ is a solid block, there is nothing to do. Otherwise, we cut $M$ into two smaller bitmaps along a horizontal or vertical line, and then recursively decompose the two smaller bitmaps into solid blocks. \nAny guillotine subdivision can be represented as a binary tree, where each internal node stores the position and orientation of a cut, and each leaf stores a single but 0 or 1 indicting the contents of the corresponding block. The size of a guillotine subdivision is the number of leaves in the corresponding binary tree (that is, the final number of solid blocks), and the depth of a guillotine subdivision is the depth of the corresponding binary tree. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute a guillotine subdivision of $M$ of minimum possible size.   \n(b) Show that a guillotine subdivision does not always yield a partition into the smallest number of solid blocks.   \n(c) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute a guillotine subdivision for $M$ with the smallest possible depth.   \n(d) Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine $M [ i , j ] ,$ given the tree representing a guillotine decomposition for $M$ and two indices $i$ and $j$ .   \n(e) Define the depth of a pixel $M [ i , j ]$ in a guillotine subdivision to be the depth of the leaf that contains that pixel. Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute a guillotine subdivision for $M$ such that the sum of the depths of the pixels as small as possible.   \n(f) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute a guillotine subdivision for $M$ such that the sum of the depths of the black pixels as small as possible. \n\n$bullet _ { 4 0 }$ . Congratulations! You’ve been hired by the giant online bookstore DeNile (“Not just a river in Egypt!”) to optimize their warehouse robots. Each book that DeNile sells has a unique ISBN (International Standard Book Number), which is just a numerical value. Each of DeNile’s warehouses contains a long row of bins, each containing multiple copies of a single book. These bins are arranged in sorted order by ISBN; each bin’s ISBN is printed on the front of the bin in machine-readable form. Books are retrieved from these bins by robots, which run along rails parallel to the row of bins. \nDeNile does not maintain a list of which bins contain which ISBN numbers; that would be too simple! Instead, to retrieve a desired book, the robot must first find that book’s bin using a binary search. Because the search requires physical motion by the robot, we can no longer assume that each step of the binary search requires $O ( 1 )$ time. Specifically: \n• The robot always starts at the “0th bin” (where the books are loaded into boxes to ship to customers). \n• Moving the robot from the ith bin to the $j$ th bin requires $alpha | i - j |$ seconds for some constant $alpha$ .   \n• The robot must be directly in front of a bin in order to read that bin’s ISBN. Reading an ISBN requires $beta$ seconds, for some constant $beta$ .   \n• Reversing the robot’s direction of motion (from increasing to decreasing or vice versa) requires $gamma$ additional seconds, for some constant $gamma$ .   \n• When the robot finds the target bin, it extracts one book from that bin and returns to “the 0th bin”. \nDesign and analyze an algorithm to compute a binary search tree over the bins that minimizes the total time the robot spends searching for books. Your input is an array $f [ 1 . . n ]$ of integers, where $f [ i ]$ is the number of times that the robot will be asked to retrieve a book from the ith bin, along with the time parameters $alpha$ , $beta$ , and $gamma$ . \nm41. A standard method to improve the cache performance of search trees is to pack more search keys and subtrees into each node. A $B$ -tree is a rooted tree in which each internal node stores up to $B$ keys and pointers to up to $B + 1$ children, each the root of a smaller $B$ -tree. Specifically, each node $nu$ stores three fields: \n• a positive integer $nu . d leq B$ , • a sorted array $nu . k e y [ 1 ldots nu . d ]$ , and an array $nu . c h i l d [ 0 ldots nu . d ]$ of child pointers. \nIn particular, the number of child pointers is always exactly one more than the number of keys.24 \nEach pointer v.child[i] is either Null or a pointer to the root of a $B$ - tree whose keys are all larger than $nu . k e y [ i ]$ and smaller than $nu . k e y [ i + 1 ]$ . In particular, all keys in the leftmost subtree v.child[0] are smaller than v.key[1], and all keys in the rightmost subtree v.child[v.d] are larger than $nu . k e y [ nu . d ]$ . \nIntuitively, you should have the following picture in mind: \nHere $T _ { i }$ is the subtree pointed to by child[i]. \nThe cost of searching for a key $x$ in a $B$ -tree is the number of nodes in the path from the root to the node containing $x$ as one of its keys. A 1-tree is just a standard binary search tree. \nFix an arbitrary positive integer $B > 0$ . (I suggest $B = 8 .$ .) Suppose your are given a sorted array $A [ 1 , ldots , n ]$ of search keys and a corresponding array $F [ 1 , ldots , n ]$ of frequency counts, where $F [ i ]$ is the number of times that we will search for $A [ i ]$ . Your task is to describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to find a $B$ -tree that minimizes the total cost of searching for the given keys with the given frequencies. \n(a) Describe a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case $B = 2$ .   \n(b) Describe an algorithm for arbitrary $B$ that runs in $O ( n ^ { B + c } )$ time for some fixed integer c.   \nn(c) Describe an algorithm for arbitrary $B$ that runs in $O ( n ^ { c } )$ time for some fixed integer c that does not depend on $B$ . \n42. A string $w$ of parentheses ( and ) and brackets [ and ] is balanced if it satisfies one of the following conditions: \n• w is the empty string. • $w = ( x )$ for some balanced string $x$ • $boldsymbol { w } = [ boldsymbol { x } ]$ for some balanced string $x$ • $w = x y$ for some balanced strings $x$ and $y$ \nFor example, the string \nis balanced, because $w = x y$ , where \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether a given string of parentheses and brackets is balanced.   \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the length of a longest balanced subsequence of a given string of parentheses and brackets.   \n(c) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the length of a shortest balanced supersequence of a given string of parentheses and brackets.   \n(d) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum edit distance from a given string of parentheses and brackets to a balanced string of parentheses and brackets.   \nn(e) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the longest common balanced subsequence of two given strings of parentheses and brackets.   \n$ { mathcal { C } } ( { mathrm { f } } )$ Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the longest palindromic balanced subsequence of a given string of parentheses and brackets.   \n$^ { bullet } ( g )$ Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the longest common palindromic balanced subsequence (whew!) of two given strings of parentheses and brackets. \n\nFor each problem, your input is an array $w [ 1 ldots n ]$ , where $w [ i ] in { ( , ) , [ , ] }$ for every index i. (You may prefer to use different symbols instead of parentheses and brackets—for example, L, R, l, r or Ã, Â, ◀, ▶—but please tell your grader what symbols you’re using!) \nn43. Congratulations! Your research team has just been awarded a $$ 50 M$ multiyear project, jointly funded by DARPA, Google, and McDonald’s, to produce DWIM: The first compiler to read programmers’ minds! Your proposal and your numerous press releases all promise that DWIM will automatically correct errors in any given piece of code, while modifying that code as little as possible. Unfortunately, now it’s time to start actually making the damn thing work. \nAs a warmup exercise, you decide to tackle the following necessary subproblem. Recall that the edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of single-character insertions, deletions, and replacements required to transform one string into the other. An arithmetic expression is a string $w$ such that \n• $w$ is a string of one or more decimal digits,   \n• $w = ( x )$ for some arithmetic expression $x$ , or   \n$w = x diamond y$ for some arithmetic expressions $x$ and $y$ and some binary operator $diamond$ . \nSuppose you are given a string of tokens from the alphabet ${ # , diamond , ( , ) }$ , where # represents a decimal digit and $0$ represents a binary operator. Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum edit distance from the given string to an arithmetic expression. \n44. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules are long chains of millions of nucleotides or bases of four different types: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U). The sequence of an RNA molecule is a string $b [ 1 ldots n ]$ , where each character $b [ i ] in { mathsf { A } , mathsf { C } , mathsf { G } , mathsf { U } }$ corresponds to a base. In addition to the chemical bonds between adjacent bases in the sequence, hydrogen bonds can form between certain pairs of bases. The set of bonded base pairs is called the secondary structure of the RNA molecule. \nWe say that two base pairs $( i , j )$ and $( i ^ { prime } , j ^ { prime } )$ with $i < j$ and $i ^ { prime } < j ^ { prime }$ overlap if $i < i ^ { prime } < j < j ^ { prime }$ or $i ^ { prime } < i < j ^ { prime } < j$ . In practice, most base pairs are non-overlapping. Overlapping base pairs create so-called pseudoknots in the secondary structure, which are essential for some RNA functions, but are more difficult to predict. \nSuppose we want to predict the best possible secondary structure for a given RNA sequence. We will adopt a drastically simplified model of secondary structure: \n• Each base can bond with at most one other base.   \n• Only A–U pairs and C–G pairs can bond.   \n• Pairs of the form $( i , i + 1 )$ and $( i , i + 2 )$ cannot bond.   \n• Bonded base pairs cannot overlap. \nThe last (and least realistic) restriction allows us to visualize RNA secondary structure as a sort of fat tree, as shown below. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm that computes the maximum possible number of bonded base pairs in a secondary structure for a given RNA sequence.   \n(b) A gap in a secondary structure is a maximal substring of unpaired bases. Large gaps lead to chemical instabilities, so secondary structures with smaller gaps are more likely. To account for this preference, let’s define the score of a secondary structure to be the sum of the squares of the gap lengths; see Figure 3.8. (This score function is utterly fictional; real RNA structure prediction requires much more complicated scoring functions.) Describe and analyze an algorithm that computes the minimum possible score of a secondary structure for a given RNA sequence. \n$triangleq 4 5$ . (a) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to determine, given a string $w$ and a regular expression $R$ , whether $w in L ( R )$ . (b) Generalized regular expressions allow the binary operator $cap$ (intersection) and the unary operator $lnot$ (complement), in addition to the usual • (concatenation), $+ phantom { } left( mathrm { o r } right)$ , and ∗ (Kleene closure) operators. NFA constructions and Kleene’s theorem imply that any generalized regular expression $E$ represents a regular language $L ( E )$ . \nDescribe and analyze an efficient algorithm to determine, given a string $w$ and a generalized regular expression $E$ , whether $w in L ( E )$ . \nIn both problems, assume that you are actually given a parse tree for the (generalized) regular expression, not just a string. \nTrees and Subtrees \n46. You’ve just been appointed as the new organizer of the first annual mandatory holiday party at Giggle (a subsidiary of Abugida). Giggle employees are organized into a strict hierarchy—a tree with the company president at the root. The all-knowing oracles in Human Resources have assigned a real number to each employee measuring how “fun” the employee is. To keep things social, there is one restriction on the guest list: an employee cannot attend the party if their immediate supervisor is also present. On the other hand, the president of the company must attend the party, even though she has a negative fun rating; it’s her company, after all. Give an algorithm that makes a guest list for the party that maximizes the sum of the “fun” ratings of the guests. \n47. Since so few people came to last year’s holiday party, the president of Giggle decides to give each employee a present instead this year. Specifically, each employee must receive on the three gifts: (1) an all-expenses-paid sixweek vacation anywhere in the world, (2) an all-the-pancakes-you-can-sort breakfast for two at Jumping Jack Flash’s Flapjack Stack Shack, or (3) a burning paper bag full of dog poop. Corporate regulations prohibit any employee from receiving exactly the same gift as his/her direct supervisor. Any employee who receives a better gift than his/her direct supervisor will almost certainly be fired in a fit of jealousy. \nAs Giggle’s official party czar, it’s your job to decide which gift each employee receives. Describe an algorithm to distribute gifts so that the minimum number of people are fired. Yes, you may send the president a flaming bag of dog poop. \nMore formally, you are given a rooted tree $T$ , representing the company hierarchy, and you want to label the nodes of $T$ with integers 1, 2, or 3, so that every node has a different label from its parent. The cost of an labeling is the number of nodes with smaller labels than their parents. See Figure 3.9 for an example. Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum-cost labeling of $T$ . \n\n48. After the Flaming Dog Poop Holiday Debacle, you were strongly encouraged to seek other employment, and so you left Giggle for rival company Twitbook. Unfortunately, the new president of Twitbook just decided to imitate Giggle by throwing her own holiday party, and in light of your past experience, appointed you as the official party organizer. The president demands that you invite exactly $k$ employees, including the president herself, and everyone who is invited is required to attend. Yeah, that’ll be fun. \nJust like at Giggle, employees at Twitbook are organized into a strict hierarchy: a tree with the company president at the root. The all-knowing oracles in Human Resources have assigned a real number to each employee indicating the awkwardness of inviting both that employee and their immediate supervisor; a negative value indicates that the employee and their supervisor actually like each other. Your goal is to choose a subset of exactly $k$ employees to invite, so that the total awkwardness of the resulting party is as small as possible. For example, if the guest list does not include both an employee and their immediate supervisor, the total awkwardness is zero. The input to your algorithm is the tree $T$ , the integer $k$ , and the awkwardness of each node in $T$ . \n(a) Describe an algorithm that computes the total awkwardness of the least awkward subset of $k$ employees, assuming the company hierarchy is described by a binary tree. That is, assume that each employee directly supervises at most two others.   \nn(b) Describe an algorithm that computes the total awkwardness of the least awkward subset of $k$ employees, with no restrictions on the company hierarchy. \n49. Suppose we need to broadcast a message to all the nodes in a rooted tree. Initially, only the root node knows the message. In a single round, any node that knows the message can forward it to at most one of its children. See Figure 3.10 for an example. \n(a) Design an algorithm to compute the minimum number of rounds required to broadcast the message to all nodes in a binary tree. $^ { * } ( mathfrak { b } )$ Design an algorithm to compute the minimum number of rounds required to broadcast the message to all nodes in an arbitrary rooted tree. [Hint: You may find techniques in the next chapter useful to prove your algorithm is correct, even though it’s not a greedy algorithm.] \n50. One day, Alex got tired of climbing in a gym and decided to take a very large group of climber friends outside to climb. The climbing area where they went, had a huge wide boulder, not very tall, with various marked hand and foot holds. Alex quickly determined an “allowed” set of moves that her group of friends can perform to get from one hold to another. \nThe overall system of holds can be described by a rooted tree $T$ with $n$ vertices, where each vertex corresponds to a hold and each edge corresponds to an allowed move between holds. The climbing paths converge as they go up the boulder, leading to a unique hold at the summit, represented by the root of T .25 \nAlex and her friends (who are all excellent climbers) decided to play a game, where as many climbers as possible are simultaneously on the boulder and each climber needs to perform a sequence of exactly $k$ moves. Each climber can choose an arbitrary hold to start from, and all moves must move away from the ground. Thus, each climber traces out a path of $k$ edges in the tree $T$ , all directed toward the root. However, no two climbers are allowed to touch the same hold; the paths followed by different climbers cannot intersect at all. \nDescribe and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum number of climbers that can play this game. More formally, you are given a rooted tree $T$ and an integer $k$ , and you want to find the largest possible number of disjoint paths in $T$ , where each path has length $k$ . Do not assume that $T$ is a binary tree. For example, given the tree $T$ below and $k = 3$ as input, your algorithm should return the integer 8. \n\n51. Let $T$ be a rooted binary tree with $n$ vertices, and let $k leq n$ be a positive integer. We would like to mark $k$ vertices in $T$ so that every vertex has a nearby marked ancestor. More formally, we define the clustering cost of any subset $K$ of vertices as \nwhere the maximum is taken over all vertices $nu$ in the tree, and $cos t ( nu , K )$ is the distance from $nu$ to its nearest ancestor in $K$ : \nIn particular, $begin{array} { r } { c o s t { ( K ) = infty } } end{array}$ if $K$ excludes the root of $T$ . \nn(a) Describe a dynamic programming algorithm to compute, given the tree $T$ and an integer $k$ , the minimum clustering cost of any subset of $k$ vertices in $T$ . For full credit, your algorithm should run in $O ( n ^ { 2 } k ^ { 2 } )$ time.   \n(b) Describe a dynamic programming algorithm to compute, given the tree $T$ and an integer $r$ , the size of the smallest subset of vertices whose clustering cost is at most $r$ . For full credit, your algorithm should run in $O ( n r )$ time.   \n(c) Show that your solution for part (b) implies an algorithm for part (a) that runs in $O ( n ^ { 2 } log { n } )$ time. \n52. This question asks you to find efficient algorithms to compute the largest common rooted subtree of two given rooted trees. Recall that a rooted tree is a connected acyclic graph with a designated node called the root. A rooted subtree of a rooted tree consists of an arbitrary node and all its descendants. The precise definition of “common” depends on which pairs of rooted trees we consider isomorphic. \n(a) Recall that a binary tree is a rooted tree in which every node has a (possibly empty) left subtree and a (possibly empty) right subtree. Two binary trees are isomorphic if and only if they are both empty, or their left subtrees are isomorphic and their right subtrees are isomorphic. Describe an algorithm to find the largest common binary subtree of two given binary trees. \n(b) In an ordered rooted tree, each node has a sequence of children, which are the roots of ordered rooted subtrees. Two ordered rooted trees are isomorphic if they are both empty, or if their ith subtrees are isomorphic for every index i. Describe an algorithm to find the largest common ordered subtree of two ordered trees $T _ { 1 }$ and $T _ { 2 }$ . $cdot _ { mathrm { ( c ) } }$ In an unordered rooted tree, each node has an unordered set of children, which are the roots of unordered rooted subtrees. Two unordered rooted trees are isomorphic if they are both empty, or the subtrees of each root can be ordered so that their ith subtrees are isomorphic for every index i. Describe an algorithm to find the largest common unordered subtree of two unordered trees $T _ { 1 }$ and $T _ { 2 }$ . \n53. This question asks you to find efficient algorithms to compute optimal subtrees in unrooted trees—connected acyclic undirected graphs. A subtree of an unrooted tree is any connected subgraph. \n(a) Suppose you are given an unrooted tree $T$ with weights on its edges, which may be positive, negative, or zero. Describe an algorithm to find a path in $T$ with maximum total weight. (b) Suppose you are given an unrooted tree $T$ with weights on its vertices, which may be positive, negative, or zero. Describe an algorithm to find a subtree of $T$ with maximum total weight. [This was a 2016 Google interview question.] (c) Let $T _ { 1 }$ and $T _ { 2 }$ be arbitrary ordered unrooted trees, meaning that the neighbors of every node have a well-defined cyclic order. Describe an algorithm to find the largest common ordered subtree of $T _ { 1 }$ and $T _ { 2 }$ . $cdot _ { mathrm { Delta ( d ) } }$ Let $T _ { 1 }$ and $T _ { 2 }$ be arbitrary unordered unrooted trees. Describe an algorithm to find the largest common unordered subtree of $T _ { 1 }$ and $T _ { 2 }$ . \n54. Rooted minors of rooted trees are a natural generalization of subsequences. A rooted minor of a rooted tree $T$ is any tree obtained by contracting one or more edges. When we contract an edge $u {  } nu$ , where $u$ is the parent of $nu$ , the children of $nu$ become new children of $u$ an\u0001d then $nu$ is deleted. In particular, the root of $T$ is also the root of every rooted minor of $T$ . \n(a) Let $T$ be a rooted tree with labeled nodes. We say that $T$ is boring if, for each node $x$ , all children of $x$ have the same label; children of different nodes may have different labels. Describe an algorithm to find the largest boring rooted minor of a given labeled rooted tree.   \n(b) Suppose we are given a rooted tree $T$ whose nodes are labeled with numbers. Describe an algorithm to find the largest heap-ordered rooted minor of $T$ . That is, your algorithm should return the largest rooted minor $M$ such that every node in $M$ has a smaller label than its children in $M$ .   \n(c) Suppose we are given a binary tree $T$ whose nodes are labeled with numbers. Describe an algorithm to find the largest binary-search-ordered rooted minor of $T$ . That is, your algorithm should return a rooted minor $M$ such that every node in $M$ has at most two children, and an inorder traversal of $M$ is an increasing subsequence of an inorder traversal of $T$ .   \n(d) Recall that a rooted tree is ordered if the children of each node have a well-defined left-to-right order. Describe an algorithm to find the largest binary-search-ordered minor of an arbitrary ordered tree $T$ whose nodes are labeled with numbers. Again, the left-to-right order of nodes in $M$ should be consistent with their order in $T$ .   \nn(e) Describe an algorithm to find the largest common ordered rooted minor of two ordered labeled rooted trees.   \nn(f) Describe an algorithm to find the largest common unordered rooted minor of two unordered labeled rooted trees.

Reading a file from tape isn’t like reading a file from disk; first we have to fast-forward past all the other files, and that takes a significant amount of time.

If the files are stored in order from 1 to $n$ , then the cost of accessing the $k$ th file is \nThe cost reflects the fact that before we read file $k$ we must first scan past all the earlier files on the tape. If we assume for the moment that each file is equally likely to be accessed, then the expected cost of searching for a random file is \nIf we change the order of the files on the tape, we change the cost of accessing the files; some files become more expensive to read, but others become cheaper. Different file orders are likely to result in different expected costs. Specifically, let $pi ( i )$ denote the index of the file stored at position i on the tape. Then the expected cost of the permutation $pi$ is \nWhich order should we use if we want this expected cost to be as small as possible? The answer seems intuitively clear: Sort the files by increasing length. But intuition is a tricky beast. The only way to be sure that this order works is to take off and nuke the entire site from orbit actually prove that it works! \nLemma 4.1. $operatorname { E } [ c o s t ( { pi } ) ]$ is minimized when $L [ pi ( i ) ] leq L [ pi ( i + 1 ) ]$ for all i. \nProof: Suppose $L [ pi ( i ) ] > L [ pi ( i + 1 ) ]$ for some index i. To simplify notation, let $a = pi ( i )$ and $b = pi ( i + 1 )$ . If we swap files $a$ and $b$ , then the cost of accessing $a$ increases by $L [ b ]$ , and the cost of accessing $b$ decreases by $boldsymbol { L } [ boldsymbol { a } ]$ . Overall, the swap changes the expected cost by $( L [ b ] - L [ a ] ) / n$ . But this change is an improvement, because $L [ b ] < L [ a ]$ . Thus, if the files are out of order, we can decrease the expected cost by swapping some mis-ordered pair of files. □ \nThis is our first example of a correct greedy algorithm. To minimize the total expected cost of accessing the files, we put the file that is cheapest to access first, and then recursively write everything else; no backtracking, no dynamic programming, just make the best local choice and blindly plow ahead. If we use an efficient sorting algorithm, the running time is clearly $O ( n log { n } )$ , plus the time required to actually write the files. To show that the greedy algorithm is actually correct, we proved that the output of any other algorithm can be improved by some sort of exchange \nLet’s generalize this idea further. Suppose we are also given an array $F [ 1 ldots n ]$ of access frequencies for each file; file i will be accessed exactly $F [ i ]$ times over the lifetime of the tape. Now the total cost of accessing all the files on the tape is \nAs before, reordering the files can change this total cost. So what order should we use if we want the total cost to be as small as possible? (This question is similar in spirit to the optimal binary search tree problem, but the target data structure and the cost function are both different, so the algorithm must be different, too.) \nWe already proved that if all the frequencies are equal, we should sort the files by increasing size. If the frequencies are all different but the file lengths $boldsymbol { L } [ i ]$ are all equal, then intuitively, we should sort the files by decreasing access frequency, with the most-accessed file first. In fact, this is not hard to prove (hint, hint) by modifying the proof of Lemma 4.1. But what if the sizes and the frequencies both vary? In this case, we should sort the files by the ratio $L / F$ . \nLemma 4.2. $Sigma c o s t ( pi )$ is minimized when $frac { L [ pi ( i ) ] } { F [ pi ( i ) ] } le frac { L [ pi ( i + 1 ) ] } { F [ pi ( i + 1 ) ] }  }$ for all i. \nProof: Suppose $L [ pi ( i ) ] / F [ pi ( i ) ] > L [ pi ( i + 1 ) ] / F [ pi ( i + i ) ]$ for some index i. To simplify notation, let $a = pi ( i )$ and $b = pi ( i { + } 1 )$ . If we swap files $a$ and $b$ , then the cost of accessing $a$ increases by $L [ b ]$ , and the cost of accessing $b$ decreases by $boldsymbol { L } [ boldsymbol { a } ]$ . Overall, the swap changes the total cost by $L [ b ] F [ a ] - L [ a ] F [ b ]$ . But this change is an improvement, because \nThus, if any two adjacent files are out of order, we can improve the total cost by swapping them. □ \n4.2 Scheduling Classes \nThe next example is slightly more complex. Suppose you decide to drop out of computer science and change your major to Applied Chaos. The Applied Chaos department offers all of its classes on the same day every week, called “Soberday” by the students (but interestingly, not by the faculty).

Your task is to choose the largest possible subset $X in { 1 , 2 , ldots , n }$ so that for any pair $i , j in X$ , either $S [ i ] > F [ j ]$ or $S [ j ] > F [ i ]$ . We can illustrate the problem by drawing each class as a rectangle whose left and right $x$ -coordinates show the start and finish times. The goal is to find a largest subset of rectangles that do not overlap vertically. \n幸\nThis problem has a fairly simple recursive solution, based on the observation that either you take class 1 or you don’t. Let $B$ denote the set of classes that end before class 1 starts, and let $A$ denote the set of classes that start after class 1 ends: \nIf class 1 is in the optimal schedule, then so are the optimal schedules for $B$ and $A$ , which we can find recursively. If not, we can find the optimal schedule for ${ 2 , 3 , ldots , n }$ recursively. So we should try both choices and take whichever one gives the better schedule. Evaluating this recursive algorithm from the bottom up gives us a dynamic programming algorithm that runs in $O ( n ^ { 3 } )$ time. I won’t bother to go through the details, because we can do better.2 \nIntuitively, we’d like the first class to finish as early as possible, because that leaves us with the largest number of remaining classes. This intuition suggests the following simple greedy algorithm. Scan through the classes in order of finish time; whenever you encounter a class that doesn’t conflict with your latest class so far, take it! See Figure 4.2 for a visualization of the resulting greedy schedule. \nWe can write the greedy algorithm somewhat more formally as shown in in Figure 4.3. (Hopefully the first line is understandable.) After the initial sort, the algorithm is a simple linear-time loop, so the entire algorithm runs in $O ( n log { n } )$ time. \nGreedySchedule(S[1 .. n], F[1 .. n]): sort $F$ and permute $s$ to match count 1 $X [ c o u n t ] gets 1$ for $i gets 2$ to $n$ $mathrm { i f }  S [ i ] > F [ X [ c o u n t ] ] $ count count + 1 $X [ c o u n t ] gets i$ return X [1 .. count] \nTo prove that GreedySchedule actually computes the largest conflict-free schedule, we use an exchange argument, similar to the one we used for tape sorting. We are not claiming that the greedy schedule is the only maximal schedule; there could be others. (Compare Figures 4.1 and 4.2!) All we can claim is that at least one of the optimal schedules is the one produced by the greedy algorithm. \nLemma 4.3. At least one maximal conflict-free schedule includes the class that finishes first. \nProof: Let $f$ be the class that finishes first. Suppose we have a maximal conflict-free schedule $X$ that does not include $f$ . Let $g$ be the first class in $X$ to finish. Since $f$ finishes before $g$ does, $f$ cannot conflict with any class in the set $X setminus { g }$ . Thus, the schedule $X ^ { prime } = X cup { f } setminus { g }$ is also conflict-free. Since $X ^ { prime }$ has the same size as $X$ , it is also maximal. □ \nTo finish the proof, we call on our old friend induction. \nTheorem 4.4. The greedy schedule is an optimal schedule. \nProof: Let $f$ be the class that finishes first, and let $A$ be the subset of classes that start after $f$ finishes. The previous lemma implies that some optimal schedule contains $f$ , so the best schedule that contains $f$ is an optimal schedule. The best schedule that includes $f$ must contain an optimal schedule for the classes that do not conflict with $f$ , that is, an optimal schedule for A. The greedy algorithm chooses $f$ and then, by the inductive hypothesis, computes an optimal schedule of classes from $A$ . □ \nThe proof might be easier to understand if we unroll the induction slightly. \nProof: Let $langle g _ { 1 } , g _ { 2 } , ldots , g _ { k } rangle$ be the sequence of classes chosen by the greedy algorithm, sorted by starting time. Suppose we have a maximal conflict-free schedule \nagain sorted by starting time, where $c _ { j }$ is different from the class $g _ { j }$ chosen by the greedy algorithm. (We could have $j = 1$ , in which case this schedule starts with a non-greedy choice $c _ { 1 }$ .) By construction, the $j$ th greedy choice $g _ { j }$ does not conflict with any earlier class $g _ { 1 } , g _ { 2 } , dotsc , g _ { j - 1 }$ , and because our schedule $s$ is conflict-free, neither does $c _ { j }$ . Moreover, $g _ { j }$ has the earliest finish time among all classes that don’t conflict with the earlier classes; in particular, $g _ { j }$ finishes before $c _ { j }$ . It follows that $g _ { j }$ does not conflict with any of the later classes cj 1, . . . , cm. Thus, the modified schedule \nis also conflict-free. (This argument is a direct generalization of Lemma 4.3, which considers the case $j = 1$ .) \nBy induction, it now follows that there is an optimal schedule $langle g _ { 1 } , g _ { 2 } , ldots , g _ { k } rangle$ , $c _ { k + 1 } , hdots , c _ { m } rangle$ that includes every class chosen by the greedy algorithm. But this is impossible unless $k = m$ ; if some class $c _ { k + 1 }$ does not conflict with any of the first $k$ greedy classes, then the greedy algorithm would choose more than $k$ classes! □ \n4.3 General Pattern \nThe basic structure of this correctness proof is exactly the same as for the tape-sorting problem: an inductive exchange argument. \n• Assume that there is an optimal solution that is different from the greedy solution.   \n• Find the “first” difference between the two solutions.",

Suppose we want to encode the following helpfully self-descriptive sentence, discovered by Lee Sallows:5 \nThis sentence contains three a’s, three c’s, two d’s, twenty-six e’s, five f’s, three g’s, eight h’s, thirteen i’s, two l’s, sixteen n’s, nine o’s, six r’s, twenty-seven s’s, twenty-two t’s, two u’s, five v’s, eight w’s, four x’s, five y’s, and only one z. \nTo keep things simple, let’s ignore the forty-four spaces, nineteen apostrophes, nineteen commas, three hyphens, and only one period, and encode only the letters, as though the message were written in scriptio continua: \nTHISSENTENCECONTAINSTHREEASTHREECSTWODSTWENTYSIXESFIVEFSTHREEGSEIGHTHSTHIRTEENISTWOLSSIXTEENNSNINEOSSIXRSTWENTYSEVENSSTWENTYTWOTSTWOUSFIVEVSEIGHTWSFOURXSFIVEYSANDONLYONEZ6\nHere is the frequency table for Sallows’ sentence: \nHuffman’s algorithm picks out the two least frequent letters, breaking ties arbitrarily—in this case, say, Z and D—and merges them together into a single \n5This sentence was first reported by Alexander Dewdney in his October 1984 “Computer Recreations” column in Scientific American. Sallows himself published the remarkable story of its discovery in 1985, along with several other self-descriptive sentences; you can find Sallows’ paper on his web site. Frustrated with the slow progress of his code running on a VAX 11/780, Sallows designed and built dedicated hardware to perform a brute-force search for self-descriptive sentences with various flavor text (“This pangram has. . . ”, “This sentence contains exactly. . . ”, and so on). Careful theoretical analysis limited the search space to just over six billion possibilities, which his 1-MHz Pangram Machine enumerated in just under two hours. \n6. . . and he talked for forty-five minutes, and nobody understood a word that he said, but we had fun fillin’ out the forms and playin’ with the pencils on the bench there. \nnew character DZ with frequency 3. This new character becomes an internal node in the code tree we are constructing, with Z and D as its children; it doesn’t matter which child is which. The algorithm then recursively constructs a Huffman code for the new frequency table \nAfter 19 merges, all 20 letters have been merged together. The record of merges gives us our code tree. The algorithm makes a number of arbitrary choices; as a result, there are actually several different Huffman codes. One such Huffman code is shown below; numbers in non-leaf nodes are frequencies for merged characters. For example, the code for A is 101000, and the code for S is 111. \nEncoding Sallows’ sentence with this particular Huffman code would yield a bit string that starts like so: \nHere is the list of costs for encoding each character in Sallows’ sentence, along with that character’s contribution to the total length of the encoded sentence: \nAltogether, the encoded message is 649 bits long. Different Huffman codes encode the same characters differently, possibly with code words of different length, but the overall length of the encoded message is the same for every Huffman code: 649 bits. \nGiven the simple structure of Huffman’s algorithm, it’s rather surprising that it produces an optimal prefix-free binary code.7 Encoding Sallows’ sentence using any prefix-free code requires at least 649 bits! Fortunately, the recursive structure makes this claim easy to prove using an exchange argument, similar to our earlier optimality proofs. We start by proving that the algorithm’s very first choice is correct. \nLemma 4.5. Let $x$ and y be the two least frequent characters (breaking ties between equally frequent characters arbitrarily). There is an optimal code tree in which $x$ and y are siblings. \nProof: I’ll actually prove a stronger statement: There is an optimal code in which $x$ and $y$ are siblings and have the largest depth of any leaf. \nLet $T$ be an optimal code tree, and suppose this tree has depth $d$ . Because $T$ is a full binary tree, it has at least two leaves at depth $d$ that are siblings. (Verify this claim by induction!) Suppose those two leaves are not $x$ and $y$ , but some other characters $a$ and $b$ . \nLet $T ^ { prime }$ be the code tree obtained by swapping $x$ and $a$ , and let $Delta =$ $d - d e p t h _ { T } ( x )$ . This swap increases the depth of $x$ by $Delta$ and decreases the depth of $a$ by $Delta$ , so \nOur assumption that $x$ is one of the two least frequent characters but $a$ is not implies $f [ x ] leq f [ a ]$ , and our assumption that $a$ has maximum depth implies $Delta geq 0$ . It follows that $c o s t ( T ^ { prime } ) leq c o s t ( T )$ . On the other hand, $T$ is an optimal code tree, so we must also have $c o s t ( T ^ { prime } ) geq c o s t ( T )$ . We conclude that $T ^ { prime }$ is also an optimal code tree. \nSimilarly, swapping $y$ and $b$ must give yet another optimal code tree. In this final optimal code tree, $x$ and $y$ are maximum-depth siblings, as required. □ \nNow optimality is guaranteed by our dear friend the Recursion Fairy! Our recursive argument relies on the following non-standard recursive definition: A full binary tree is either a single node, or a full binary tree where some leaf has been replaced by an internal node with two leaf children. \nTheorem 4.6. Every Huffman code is an optimal prefix-free binary code. \nProof: If the message has only one or two distinct characters, the theorem is trivial, so assume otherwise. \nLet $f [ 1 . . n ]$ be the original input frequencies, and assume without loss of generality that $f [ 1 ]$ and $f [ 2 ]$ are the two smallest frequencies. To set up the recursive subproblem, define $f [ n + 1 ] = f [ 1 ] + f [ 2 ]$ . Our earlier exchange argument implies that 1 and 2 are (deepest) siblings in some optimal code for $f [ 1 . . n ]$ . \n\nLet $T ^ { prime }$ be the Huffman tree for $f [ 3 ldots n + 1 ]$ ; the inductive hypothesis implies that $T ^ { prime }$ is an optimal code tree for the smaller set of frequencies. To obtain the final code tree $T$ , we replace the leaf labeled $n + 1$ with an internal node with two children, labelled 1 and 2. I claim that $T$ is optimal for the original frequency array $f [ 1 ldots n ]$ . \nTo prove this claim, we can express the cost of $T$ in terms of the cost of $T ^ { prime }$ as follows. (In these equations, depth(i) denotes the depth of the leaf labelled i in either $T$ or $T ^ { prime }$ ; each leaf that appears in both $T$ and $T ^ { prime }$ has the same depth in both trees.) \nThis equation implies that minimizing the cost of $T$ is equivalent to minimizing the cost of $T ^ { prime }$ ; in particular, attaching leaves labeled 1 and 2 to the leaf in $T ^ { prime }$ labeled $n + 1$ gives an optimal code tree for the original frequencies. □ \nTo efficiently construct a Huffman code, we keep the characters in a priority queue, using the character frequencies as priorities. We can represent the code tree as three arrays of indices, listing the Left and Right children and the $P$ arent of each node. The leaves of the final code tree are nodes at indices 1 through $n$ , and the root is the node with index $2 n - 1$ . Pseudocode for the algorithm is shown in Figure 4.4. BuildHuffman performs $O ( n )$ priority-queue operations: exactly $2 n - 1$ Inserts and $2 n - 2$ ExtractMins. If we implement the priority queue as a standard binary heap, each of these operations requires $O ( log n )$ time, and thus the entire algorithm runs in $O ( n log { n } )$ time. \nFinally, simple algorithms to encode and decode messages using a fixed Huffman code are shown in Figure 4.5; both algorithms run in $O ( m )$ time, where $m$ is the length of the encoded message.",

Each year, doctors submit a ranked list of all hospitals where they would accept an internship, and each hospital submits a ranked list of doctors they would accept as interns. The NRMP then computes an matching between doctors and hospitals that satisfies the following stability requirement. A matching is unstable if there is a doctor $alpha$ and hospital $B$ that would be both happier with each other than with their current match; that is, \n• $alpha$ is matched with some other hospital $A$ , even though she prefers $B$ .   \n• $B$ is matched with some other doctor $beta$ , even though they prefer $alpha$ . \nIn this case, we call $left( alpha , B right)$ an unstable pair for the matching. The goal of the Resident Match is a stable matching, which is a matching with no unstable pairs. \nFor simplicity, I’ll assume from now on that there are exactly the same number of doctors and hospitals; each hospital offers exactly one internship; each doctor ranks all hospitals and vice versa; and finally, there are no ties in the doctors’ or hospitals’ rankings.9 \nSome Bad Ideas \nAt first glance, it is not even clear that a stable matching always exists! Certainly not every matching of doctors and hospitals is stable. Suppose there are three doctors (Dr. Quincy, Dr. Rotwang, Dr. Shephard, represented by lower-case letters) and three hospitals (Arkham Asylum, Bethlem Royal Hospital, and County General Hospital, represented by upper-case letters), who rank each other as follows: \nThe matching ${ A q , B r , C s }$ is unstable, because Arkham would rather hire Dr. Rotwang than Dr. Quincy, and Dr. Rotwang would rather work at Arkham than at Bedlam. $( A , r )$ is an unstable pair for this matching. \nOne might imagine using an incremental algorithm that starts with an arbitrary matching, and then greedily performs exchanges to resolve instabilities. Unfortunately, resolving one instability can create new ones; in fact, this incremental “improvement” can lead to an infinite loop. For example, if we start with our earlier unstable matching ${ A q , B r , C s }$ , each of the following exchanges resolves one unstable pair (indicated over the arrow), but the sequence of exchanges leads back to the original matching:10 \nAlternatively, we might try the following multi-round greedy protocol. In each round, every unmatched hospital makes an offer to their favorite unmatched doctor, then every unmatched doctor with an offer accepts their favorite offer. It’s not hard to prove that at least one new doctor-hospital pair is matched in each round, so the algorithm always ends with a matching. For the previous example input, we already have a stable matching ${ A r , B s , C q }$ at the end of the first round! But consider the following input instead: \nIn the first round, Dr. Shephard accepts an offer from County, and Dr. Quincy accepts an offer from Bedlam (rejecting Arkham’s offer), leaving only Dr. Rotwang and Arkham unmatched. Thus, the protocol ends with the matching ${ A r , B q , C s }$ after two rounds. Unfortunately, this matching is unstable; Arkham and Dr. Shephard prefer each other to their matches. \nThe Boston Pool and Gale-Shapley Algorithms \nIn 1952, the NRMP adopted the “Boston Pool” algorithm to assign interns, so named because it had been previously used by a regional clearinghouse in the Boston area. Ten years later, David Gale and Lloyd Shapley described and formally analyzed a generalization of the Boston Pool algorithm and proved that it computes a stable matching. Gale and Shapley used the metaphor of college admissions. Essentially the same algorithm was independently developed by Elliott Peranson in 1972 for use in medical school admissions. Similar algorithms have since been adopted for many other matching markets, including faculty hiring in France, hiring of new economics PhDs in the United States, university admission in Germany, public school admission in New York and Boston, billet assignments for US Navy sailors, and kidney-matching programs.",

Ten years later, David Gale and Lloyd Shapley described and formally analyzed a generalization of the Boston Pool algorithm and proved that it computes a stable matching. Gale and Shapley used the metaphor of college admissions. Essentially the same algorithm was independently developed by Elliott Peranson in 1972 for use in medical school admissions. Similar algorithms have since been adopted for many other matching markets, including faculty hiring in France, hiring of new economics PhDs in the United States, university admission in Germany, public school admission in New York and Boston, billet assignments for US Navy sailors, and kidney-matching programs. \nShapley was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics for his research on stable matchings, together with Alvin Roth, who significantly extended Shapley’s work and used it to develop several real-world exchanges. (Gale did not share the prize, because he died in 2008.) \nLike our last failed greedy algorithm, the Gale-Shapley algorithm proceeds in rounds until every position has been accepted. Each round has two stages: \n1. An arbitrary unmatched hospital $A$ offers its position to the best doctor $alpha$ (according to A’s preference list) who has not already rejected it. 2. If $alpha$ is unmatched, she (tentatively) accepts $ { boldsymbol { A } } ^ { prime }  { boldsymbol { s } }$ offer. If $alpha$ already has a match but prefers $A _ { i }$ , she rejects her current match and (tentatively) accepts the new offer from $A .$ Otherwise, $alpha$ rejects the new offer. \nEach doctor ultimately accepts the best offer that she receives, according to her preference list.11 In short, hospitals make offers greedily, and doctors accept offers greedily. The doctors’ ability to reject their current matches in favor of better offers is the key to making this mutual greedy strategy work. \nFor example, suppose that there are four doctors (Dr. Quincy, Dr. Rotwang, Dr. Shephard, and Dr. Tam) and four hospitals (Arkham Asylum, Bethlem Royal Hospital, County General Hospital, and The Dharma Initiative), who rank each other as follows: \nGiven these preference lists as input, the Gale-Shapley algorithm might proceed as follows: \n1. Arkham makes an offer to Dr. Tam.   \n2. Bedlam makes an offer to Dr. Rotwang.   \n3. County makes an offer to Dr. Tam, who rejects her earlier offer from Arkham.   \n4. Dharma makes an offer to Dr. Shephard. (From this point on, there is only one unmatched hospital, so the algorithm has no more choices.)   \n5. Arkham makes an offer to Dr. Shephard, who rejects her earlier offer from Dharma.   \n6. Dharma makes an offer to Dr. Rotwang, who rejects her earlier offer from Bedlam.   \n7. Bedlam makes an offer to Dr. Tam, who rejects her earlier offer from County.   \n8. County makes an offer to Dr. Rotwang, who rejects it.   \n9. County makes an offer to Dr. Shephard, who rejects it.   \n10. County makes an offer to Dr. Quincy. \n\nAfter the tenth round, all pending offers are accepted, and the algorithm returns the matching ${ A s , B t , C q , D r }$ . You can (and should) verify by brute force that this matching is stable, even though no doctor was hired by her favorite hospital, and no hospital hired their favorite doctor; in fact, County ended up hiring their least favorite doctor. This is not the only stable matching for these preference lists; the matching ${ A r , B s , C q , D t }$ is also stable. \nRunning Time \nAnalyzing the number of offers performed by the algorithm is relatively straightforward (which is why we’re doing it first). Each hospital makes an offer to each doctor at most once, so the algorithm makes at most $n ^ { 2 }$ offers. \nTo analyze the actual running time, however, we need to specify the algorithm in more detail. How are the preference lists given to the algorithm? How does the algorithm decide whether any hospital is unmatched, and if so, how does it find an unmatched hospital? How does the algorithm store the tentative matchings? How does the algorithm decide whether a doctor prefers her new offer to her current match? Most fundamentally: How does the algorithm actually represent doctors and hospitals? \nOne possibility is to represent each doctor and hospital by a unique integer between 1 and $n$ , and to represent preferences as two arrays Dpref $left[ 1 ldots n , 1 ldots n right]$ and Hpref[ $1 ldots n , 1 ldots n ] _ { scriptscriptstyle }$ , where Dpref $displaystyle { dot { mathbf { rho } } } _ { i , r } ]$ represents the rth hospital in doctor i’s preference list, and $H P r e f [ j , r ]$ represents the rth doctor in hospital j’s preference list. With the input in this form, the Boston Pool algorithm can execute each offer in constant time, after some initial preprocessing; the overall implementation runs in $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time. We leave the remaining details as a straightforward exercise. \nA somewhat harder exercise is to prove that there are inputs (and choices of who makes offers when) that force $Omega ( n ^ { 2 } )$ offers to be made before the algorithm halts. Thus, our $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ upper bound on the worst-case running time is tight. \nCorrectness \nBut why is the algorithm correct at all? How do we know that it always computes a stable matching, or any complete matching for that matter?",

Because every doctor accepts the best offer she receives, $alpha$ received no offer she liked more than $A$ ; in particular, $B$ never made an offer to $alpha$ . On the other hand, $B$ made offers to every doctor they prefer over their final match $beta$ . It follows that $B$ prefers $beta$ over $alpha$ , which means $left( boldsymbol { alpha } , boldsymbol { B } right)$ is not an unstable pair. We conclude that there are no unstable pairs; the matching is stable! \nOptimality! \nSurprisingly, the correctness of the Gale-Shapley algorithm does not depend on which hospital makes its offer in each round. In fact, no matter which unassigned hospital makes an offer in each round, the algorithm always computes the same matching! Let’s say that $alpha$ is a feasible doctor for A if there is a stable matching that assigns doctor $alpha$ to hospital $A$ . \nLemma 4.7. During the Gale-Shapley algorithm, each hospital A is rejected only by doctors that are infeasible for A. \nProof: We prove the lemma by induction on the number of rounds. Consider an arbitrary round of the algorithm, in which doctor $alpha$ rejects one hospital $A$ for another hospital $B$ . The rejection implies that $alpha$ prefers $B$ to $A .$ . Each doctor that appears higher than $alpha$ in $B$ ’s preference list already rejected $B$ in an earlier round and therefore, by the inductive hypothesis, is infeasible for $B$ . \nNow consider an arbitrary matching (of the same doctors and hospitals) that assigns $alpha$ to $A$ .

(a) Prove that it is possible for the Gale-Shapley algorithm to perform $Omega ( n ^ { 2 } )$ offers before termination. (You need to describe both a suitable input and a sequence of $Omega ( n ^ { 2 } )$ valid offers.) (b) Describe for any integer $n$ a set of preferences for $n$ doctors and $n$ hospitals that forces the Gale-Shapley algorithm to execute $Omega ( n ^ { 2 } )$ rounds, no matter which valid proposal is made in each round. [Hint: Part $( b )$ implies part (a).] \n11. Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to determine whether a given set of hospital and doctor preferences has to a unique stable matching. \n12. Consider a generalization of the stable matching problem, where some doctors do not rank all hospitals and some hospitals do not rank all doctors, and a doctor can be assigned to a hospital only if each appears in the other’s preference list. In this case, there are three additional unstable situations: \n• A matched hospital prefers an unmatched doctor to its assigned match. • A matched doctor prefers an unmatched hospital to her assigned match. • An unmatched doctor and an unmatched hospital appear in each other’s preference lists. \nA stable matching in this setting may leave some doctors and/or hospitals unmatched, even though their preference lists are non-empty. For example, if every doctor lists Harvard as their only acceptable hospital, and every hospital lists Dr. House as their only acceptable intern, then only House and Harvard will be matched. \nDescribe and analyze an efficient algorithm that computes a stable matching in this more general setting. [Hint: Reduce to an instance where every doctor ranks every hospital and vice versa, and then invoke Gale-Shapley.] \n13. The Scandinavian furniture company Fürni has hired $n$ drivers to deliver $n$ identical orders to $n$ different addresses in Wilmington, Delaware. Each driver has their own well-established delivery route through Wilmington that visits all $n$ addresses. Assuming they follow their routes as they always do, two drivers never visit the same addresses at the same time. \nIn principle, each of the $n$ drivers can deliver their furniture to any of the $n$ addresses, but there’s a complication. One of the drivers has secretly wired proximity sensors and explosives to the Johannshamn sofas (with the Strinne green stripe pattern). If two sofas are ever at the same address at the same time, both will explode, destroying both the delivery truck and the building at that address. This can only happen if one driver delivers an order to that address, and then later another driver visits that same address while the furniture is still on their truck. \nYour job as the Fürni dispatcher is to assign each driver to a delivery address. Describe an algorithm to assign addresses to drivers so that each of the n addresses receives their furniture order and there are no explosions. \nFor example, suppose Jack’s route visits 537 Paper Street at 6pm and 1888 Franklin Street at $8 mathrm { p m }$ , and Marla’s route visits 537 Paper at 7pm and 1888 Franklin at 9pm. Then Jack should deliver to 1888 Franklin, and Marla should deliver to 537 Paper; otherwise, there would be an explosion at 1888 Franklin at 8pm. (Cue the Pixies.) [Hint: Jack and Marla are a bit unstable.] \n14. Suppose you are a simple shopkeeper living in a country with $n$ different types of coins, with values $1 = c [ 1 ] < c [ 2 ] < cdots < c [ n ]$ . (In the U.S., for example, $n = 6$ and the values are 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 cents.) Your beloved and benevolent dictator, El Generalissimo, has decreed that whenever you give a customer change, you must use the smallest possible number of coins, so as not to wear out the image of El Generalissimo lovingly engraved on each coin by servants of the Royal Treasury. \n(a) In the United States, there is a simple greedy algorithm that always results in the smallest number of coins: subtract the largest coin and recursively give change for the remainder. El Generalissimo does not approve of American capitalist greed. Show that there is a set of coin values for which the greedy algorithm does not always give the smallest possible of coins. \n\n(b) Now suppose El Generalissimo decides to impose a currency system where the coin denominations are consecutive powers $b ^ { 0 } , b ^ { 1 } , b ^ { 2 } , ldots , b ^ { k }$ of some integer $b geq 2$ . Prove that despite El Generalissimo’s disapproval, the greedy algorithm described in part (a) does make optimal change in this currency system.   \n(c) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to determine, given a target amount $T$ and a sorted array $c [ 1 ldots n ]$ of coin denominations, the smallest number of coins needed to make $T$ cents in change. Assume that $c [ 1 ] = 1$ , so that it is possible to make change for any amount $T$ . \n15. Suppose you are given an array $A [ 1 ldots n ]$ of integers, each of which may be positive, negative, or zero. A contiguous subarray $A [ i ldots j ]$ is called a positive interval if the sum of its entries is greater than zero. Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum number of positive intervals that cover every positive entry in $A$ . For example, given the following array as input, your algorithm should output 3. If every entry in the input array is negative, your algorithm should output 0. \n16. Consider the following process. At all times you have a single positive integer $x$ , which is initially equal to 1. In each step, you can either increment $x$ or double $x$ . Your goal is to produce a target value $n$ . For example, you can produce the integer 10 in four steps as follows: \nObviously you can produce any integer $n$ using exactly $n - 1$ increments, but for almost all values of $n$ , this is horribly inefficient. Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum number of steps required to produce any given integer $n$ . \n17. Suppose we have $n$ skiers with heights given in an array $P [ 1 . . n ]$ , and $n$ skis with heights given in an array $S [ 1 . . n ]$ . Describe an efficient algorithm to assign a ski to each skier, so that the average difference between the height of a skier and her assigned ski is as small as possible. The algorithm should compute a permutation $sigma$ such that the expression \n\nis as small as possible. \n18. Alice wants to throw a party and she is trying to decide who to invite. She has n people to choose from, and she knows which pairs of these people know each other. She wants to invite as many people as possible, subject to two constraints: \n• For each guest, there should be at least five other guests that they already know.   \n• For each guest, there should be at least five other guests that they don’t already know. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm that computes the largest possible number of guests Alice can invite, given a list of $n$ people and the list of pairs who know each other. \n19. Suppose we are given two arrays $C [ 1 ldots n ]$ and $R [ 1 . . n ]$ of positive integers. An $n times n$ matrix of 0s and 1s agrees with $R$ and $C$ if, for every index $i$ , the ith row contains $R [ i ]$ 1s, and the ith column contains $C [ i ]$ 1s. Describe and analyze an algorithm that either constructs a matrix that agrees with $R$ and $C$ , or correctly reports that no such matrix exists. \n20. You’ve just accepted a job from Elon Musk, delivering burritos from San Francisco to New York City. You get to drive a Burrito-Delivery Vehicle through Elon’s new Transcontinental Underground Burrito-Delivery Tube, which runs in a direct line between these two cities.12 \nYour Burrito-Delivery Vehicle runs on single-use batteries, which must be replaced after at most 100 miles. The actual fuel is virtually free, but the batteries are expensive and fragile, and therefore must be installed only by official members of the Transcontinental Underground Burrito-Delivery Vehicle Battery-Replacement Technicians’ Union.13 Thus, even if you replace your battery early, you must still pay full price for each new battery to be installed. Moreover, your Vehicle is too small to carry more than one battery at a time. \nThere are several fueling stations along the Tube; each station charges a different price for installing a new battery. Before you start your trip, you carefully print the Wikipedia page listing the locations and prices of every fueling station along the Tube. Given this information, how do you decide the best places to stop for fuel? \nMore formally, suppose you are given two arrays $D [ 1 ldots n ]$ and $C [ 1 ldots n ]$ , where $D [ i ]$ is the distance from the start of the Tube to the ith station, and $C [ i ]$ is the cost to replace your battery at the ith station. Assume that your trip starts and ends at fueling stations (so $D [ 1 ] = 0$ and $D [ n ]$ is the total length of your trip), and that your car starts with an empty battery (so you must install a new battery at station 1). \n(a) Describe and analyze a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of refueling stops needed to complete your trip. Don’t forget to prove that your algorithm is correct.   \n(b) But what you really want to minimize is the total cost of travel. Show that your greedy algorithm in part (a) does not produce an optimal solution when extended to this setting.   \n(c) Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the locations of the fuel stations you should stop at to minimize the total cost of travel. \n21. You’ve been hired to store a sequence of $n$ books on shelves in a library. The order of the books is fixed by the cataloging system and cannot be changed; each shelf must store a contiguous interval of the given sequence of books. You are given two arrays $H [ 1 ldots n ]$ and $T [ 1 . . n ]$ , where $H [ i ]$ and $T [ i ]$ are respectively the height and thickness of the ith book in the sequence. All shelves in this library have the same length $L$ ; the total thickness of all books on any single shelf cannot exceed $L$ . \n(a) Suppose all the books have the same height $h$ and the shelves have height larger than $h$ , so every book fits on every shelf. Describe and analyze a greedy algorithm to store the books in as few shelves as possible. [Hint: The algorithm is obvious, but why is it correct?]   \n(b) That was a nice warmup, but now here’s the real problem. In fact the books have different heights, but you can adjust the height of each shelf to match the tallest book on that shelf. (In particular, you can change the height of any empty shelf to zero.) Now your task is to store the books so that the sum of the heights of the shelves is as small as possible. Show that your greedy algorithm from part (a) does not always give the best solution to this problem.   \n(c) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the best matching between books and shelves as described in part (b). \n22. A string w of parentheses ( and ) is balanced if it satisfies one of the following conditions: \n• $w$ is the empty string. • $w = ( x )$ for some balanced string $x$ • $w = x y$ for some balanced strings $x$ and $y$ \nFor example, the string \nis balanced, because $w = x y$ , where \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether a given string of parentheses is balanced.   \n(b) Describe and analyze a greedy algorithm to compute the length of a longest balanced subsequence of a given string of parentheses. As usual, don’t forget to prove your algorithm is correct. \nFor both problems, your input is an array $w [ 1 ldots n ]$ , where for each i, either $boldsymbol { w } [ i ] = ( mathrm { o r } boldsymbol { w } [ i ] = )$ . Both of your algorithms should run in $O ( n )$ time. \n23. One day Alex got tired of climbing in a gym and decided to take a large group of climber friends outside to climb. They went to a climbing area with a huge wide boulder, not very tall, with several marked hand and foot holds. Alex quickly determined an “allowed” set of moves that her group of friends can perform to get from one hold to another. \nThe overall system of holds can be described by a rooted tree $T$ with $n$ vertices, where each vertex corresponds to a hold and each edge corresponds to an allowed move between holds. The climbing paths converge as they go up the boulder, leading to a unique hold at the summit, represented by the root of $T$ . \nAlex and her friends (who are all excellent climbers) decided to play a game, where as many climbers as possible are simultaneously on the boulder and each climber needs to perform a sequence of exactly $k$ moves. Each climber can choose an arbitrary hold to start from, and all moves must move away from the ground. Thus, each climber traces out a path of $k$ edges in the tree $T$ , all directed toward the root. However, no two climbers are allowed to touch the same hold; the paths followed by different climbers cannot intersect at all. \n(a) Describe and analyze a greedy algorithm to compute the maximum number of climbers that can play this game. Your algorithm is given a rooted tree $T$ and an integer $k$ as input, and it should compute the largest possible number of disjoint paths in $T$ , where each path has length $k$ . Do not assume that $T$ is a binary tree. For example, given the tree below as input, your algorithm should return the integer 8. \n\n(b) Now suppose each vertex in $T$ has an associated reward, and your goal is to maximize the total reward of the vertices in your paths, instead of the total number of paths. Show that your greedy algorithm does not always return the optimal reward.   \n(c) Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum possible reward, as described in part (b). \n24. Congratulations! You have successfully conquered Camelot, transforming the former battle-scarred hereditary monarchy into an anarcho-syndicalist commune, where citizens take turns to act as a sort of executive-officerfor-the-week, but with all the decisions of that officer ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting, by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs, but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more major. . . . \nAs a final symbolic act, you order the Round Table (surprisingly, an actual circular table) to be split into pizza-like wedges and distributed to the citizens of Camelot as trophies. Each citizen has submitted a request for an angular wedge of the table, specified by two angles—for example: Sir Robin the Brave might request the wedge from $1 7 . 2 3 ^ { circ }$ to $4 2 ^ { circ }$ , and Sir Lancelot the Pure might request the $2 ^ { circ }$ wedge from $3 5 9 ^ { circ }$ to $1 ^ { circ }$ . Each citizen will be happy if and only if they receive precisely the wedge that they requested. Unfortunately, some of these ranges overlap, so satisfying all the citizens’ requests is simply impossible. Welcome to politics. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to find the maximum number of requests that can be satisfied. [Hint: The output of your algorithm should not change if you rotate the table. Do not assume that angles are integers.] \n25. Suppose you are standing in a field surrounded by several large balloons. You want to use your brand new Acme Brand Zap-O-MaticTM to pop all the balloons, without moving from your current location. The Zap-O-MaticTM shoots a high-powered laser beam, which pops all the balloons it hits. Since each shot requires enough energy to power a small country for a year, you want to fire as few shots as possible. \nThe minimum zap problem can be stated more formally as follows. Given a set $C$ of $n$ circles in the plane, each specified by its radius and the $( x , y )$ coordinates of its center, compute the minimum number of rays from the origin that intersect every circle in $C$ . Your goal is to find an efficient algorithm for this problem. \n(a) Suppose it is possible to shoot a ray that does not intersect any balloons. Describe and analyze a greedy algorithm that solves the minimum zap problem in this special case. [Hint: See Exercise 4.]   \n(b) Describe and analyze a greedy algorithm whose output is within 1 of optimal. That is, if $m$ is the minimum number of rays required to hit every balloon, then your greedy algorithm must output either $m$ or $m + 1$ . (Of course, you must prove this fact.)   \n(c) Describe an algorithm that solves the minimum zap problem in $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time.   \n(d) Describe an algorithm that solves the minimum zap problem in $O ( n log { n } )$ time. \nAssume you have a subroutine that tells you the range of angles of rays that intersects an arbitrary circle $c$ in $O ( 1 )$ time. This subroutine is not difficult to write, but it’s not the interesting part of the problem. \n[T]he distributions and partitions of knowledge are not like several lines that meet in one angle, and so touch but in a point, but are like branches of a tree that meet in a stem, which hath a dimension and quantity of entireness and continuance before it come to discontinue and break itself into arms and boughs. \n— Francis Bacon, The Advancement of Learning (1605) \nThus you see, most noble Sir, how this type of solution bears little relationship to mathematics, and I do not understand why you expect a mathematician to produce it, rather than anyone else. \n— Leonhard Euler, describing the Königsburg bridge problem in a letter to Carl Leonhard Gottlieb Ehler (April 3, 1736) \nWell, ya turn left by the fire station in the village and take the old post road by the reservoir and. . . no, that won’t do. \nBest to continue straight on by the tar road until you reach the schoolhouse and then turn left on the road to Bennett’s Lake until. . . no, that won’t work either. \nEast Millinocket, ya say?

Complex family “trees” have been used for centuries to settle legal questions about marriage, inheritance, and royal succession. Civil law in the Roman empire, later adopted as canon law by the early Catholic Church, forbade marriage between first cousins or closer relatives. In the early ninth century, the Church changed both the required distance and the method of computation. Where the Roman computatio legalis required the sum of the distances to the nearest common ancestor to be at least four, the newer computatio canonica required the maximum of the two distances to be at least seven. In 1215, bowing to practical considerations (and actual practice), the Church relaxed the minimum required distance for marriage to four.1 The left diagram in Figure 5.2 illustrates a particularly convoluted case: Tirius and Theburga marry and have a son Gaius, after which Tirius dies; Theburga then marries Lothar, bears him a son, and dies; finally, Lothar and Bertha marry and have a daughter Gemma. Can Gaius’s son legally marry Gemma’s daughter? \n\nPate Smammomu Chehergy mater Ddrmmam Batu Terawmtromu matha Eline Aater- Eyeburge   \nE CE 3   \nafgiguo Debergnro epteimib Lguie Paprt   \nmortua Lothaig agpatet   \nfunapona ee Saiue eptmis Benpmig nttfowroptep hafaBonma -npaegnifo ftpater icub fint Fila Batya   \nmortothdb etllaeforon filuuberfiite   \ngamat-day 1   \nfslothario equofun pitfi onitai Rlu 7 puta fater a 3 hlia eacaonhemrioit) icm piEenptapts comamfei'e raautfsgiiug edemi lota rluub tariuB 5 fgumpfent' uB fiae Rt Berhe atSertaElia C \nIn the late 1600s, French mathematician Pierre Varignon developed a graphical method for finding the equilibrium position of a tree-like network of ropes under tension, building on earlier work by Simon Stevin published a century earlier. Varignon observed that when the ropes are at equilibrium, one can draw a graph whose edges are segments parallel to the ropes, with lengths equal to the forces along those ropes, such that the ropes meeting at any point in the network define a closed cycle in the graph. Varignon’s method of “graphical statics” was not published in complete detail until 1725, two years after his death. These graphs are now known as reciprocal force diagrams or Maxwell-Cremona diagrams, after James Clerk Maxwell and Luigi Cremona, who (along with Carl Culmann and others) developed a rich theory of reciprocal diagrams in the late 1800s. \nOf course, there are many other familiar examples of graphs, like board games (dating to antiquity); vertices and edges of convex polyhedra (formally studied by ancient Greek philosophers, but much older); visualizations of star patterns (already developed in East Asia by the 7th century ce); knight’s tours (described by al-Adli, Rudrat.a, al-Suli, and others in the 9th and 10th centuries), mazes (introduced in their modern form by Giovanni Fontana circa 1420); geodetic triangulations (introduced by Gemma Frisius in 1533, and used to calculate the circumference of the earth by Willebrod Snell in 1615 and to define the meter in 1799), Leonhard Euler’s well-known partial2 solution to the Bridges of Königsburg puzzle (1735); telegraph and other communication networks (first proposed in 1753, developed by Ronalds, Schilling, Gauss, Weber, and others in the early 1800s, and deployed worldwide by the late 1800s); electrical circuits (formalized in the early 1800s by Ohm, Maxwell, Kirchhoff, and others); molecular structural formulas (introduced independently by August Kekulé in 1857 and Archibald Couper in 1858); social networks (first studied in the mid-1930s by sociologist Jacob Moreno); digital electronic circuits (proposed by Charles Sanders Peirce in 1886, and cast into their modern form by Claude Shannon in 1937); and yeah, okay, if you insist, the modern internet. \nThe word “graph” for the abstract mathematical was coined by James Sylvester in $^ { 1 8 7 8 }$ , who adapted Kekulé’s “chemicographs” to describe certain algebraic invariants, at the suggestion of his colleague William Clifford.

In an undirected graph, the edges are unordered pairs, or just sets of size two; I usually write $boldsymbol { u } nu$ instead of ${ u , nu }$ to denote the undirected edge between $u$ and $nu$ . In a directed graph, the edges are ordered pairs of vertices; I usually write $mathbf { Delta } u to nu$ instead of $( u , nu )$ to denote the directed edge from $u$ to $nu$ . \nFollowing standard (but admittedly confusing) practice, I will also use $V$ to denote the number of vertices in a graph, and $E$ to denote the number of edges. Thus, in any undirected graph we have $begin{array} { r } { 0 leq E leq binom { V } { 2 } } end{array}$ , and in any directed graph we have $0 leq E leq V ( V - 1 )$ . \nThe endpoints of an edge $u nu$ or $u {  } nu$ are its vertices $u$ and $nu$ . We distinguish the endpoints of a directed edge $u {  } nu$ \u0001by calling $u$ the tail and $nu$ the head. \nThe definition of a graph as a p\u0001air of sets forbids multiple undirected edges with the same endpoints, or multiple directed edges with the same head and the same tail. (The same directed graph can contain both a directed edge $u {  } nu$ and its reversal $nu {  } u .$ .) Similarly, the definition of an undirected edge as a\u0001set of vertices forbids\u0001an undirected edge from a vertex to itself. Graphs without loops and parallel edges are often called simple graphs; non-simple graphs are sometimes called multigraphs. Despite the formal definitional gap, most algorithms for simple graphs extend to multigraphs with little or no modification, and for that reason, I see no need for a formal definition here. \nFor any edge uv in an undirected graph, we call $u$ a neighbor of $nu$ and vice versa, and we say that $u$ and $nu$ are adjacent. The degree of a node is its number of neighbors. In directed graphs, we distinguish two kinds of neighbors. For any directed edge $u {  } nu$ , we call $u$ a predecessor of $nu$ , and we call $nu$ a successor of $u$ . The in-degree\u0001of a vertex is its number of predecessors; the out-degree is its number of successors. \nA graph $G ^ { prime } = ( V ^ { prime } , E ^ { prime } )$ is a subgraph of $G = ( V , E )$ if $V ^ { prime } subseteq V$ and $E ^ { prime } subseteq E$ . A proper subgraph of $G$ is any subgraph other than $G$ itself. \nA walk in an undirected graph $G$ is a sequence of vertices, where each adjacent pair of vertices are adjacent in $G$ ; informally, we can also think of a walk as a sequence of edges. A walk is called a path if it visits each vertex at most once. For any two vertices $u$ and $nu$ in a graph $G$ , we say that $nu$ is reachable from $u$ if $G$ contains a walk (and therefore a path) between $u$ and $nu$ . An undirected graph is connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. Every undirected graph consists of one or more components, which are its maximal connected subgraphs; two vertices are in the same component if and only if there is a path between them.4 \nA walk is closed if it starts and ends at the same vertex; a cycle is a closed walk that enters and leaves each vertex at most once. An undirected graph is acyclic if no subgraph is a cycle; acyclic graphs are also called forests. A tree is a connected acyclic graph, or equivalently, one component of a forest. A spanning tree of an undirected graph $G$ is a subgraph that is a tree and contains every vertex of $G$ . A graph has a spanning tree if and only if it is connected. A spanning forest of $G$ is a collection of spanning trees, one for each component of $G$ . \n\nDirected graphs require slightly different definitions. A directed walk is a sequence of vertices $nu _ { 0 } {  } nu _ { 1 } {  } nu _ { 2 } {  } cdots {  } nu _ { ell }$ such that $nu _ { i - 1 } {  } nu _ { i }$ is a directed edge for every index $i$ ; directed\u0001path\u0001s an\u0001d dir\u0001ected cycles are de\u0001fined similarly. Vertex $nu$ is reachable from vertex $u$ in a directed graph $G$ if and only if $G$ contains a directed walk (and therefore a directed path) from $u$ to $nu$ . A directed graph is strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. A directed graph is acyclic if it does not contain a directed cycle; directed acyclic graphs are often called dags. \n5.3 Representations and Examples \nThe most common way to visually represent graphs is by drawing them. A drawing of a graph maps each vertex to a point in the plane (typically drawn as a small circle or some other shape) and each edge to a curve or straight line segment between the two vertices. A graph is planar if it has a drawing where no two edges cross; such a drawing is also called an embedding.5 The same graph can have many different drawings, so it is important not to confuse a particular drawing with the graph itself. In particular, planar graphs can have non-planar drawings! \nHowever, drawings are far from the only useful representation of graphs. For example, the intersection graph of a collection of geometric objects has a node for every object and an edge for every intersecting pair of objects. Whether a particular graph can be represented as an intersection graph depends on what kind of object you want to use for the vertices. Different types of objects—line segments, rectangles, circles, etc.—define different classes of graphs. One particularly useful type of intersection graph is an interval graph, whose vertices are intervals on the real line, with an edge between any two intervals that overlap.",

Different types of objects—line segments, rectangles, circles, etc.—define different classes of graphs. One particularly useful type of intersection graph is an interval graph, whose vertices are intervals on the real line, with an edge between any two intervals that overlap. \n\nAnother good example is the dependency graph of a recursive algorithm. Dependency graphs are directed acyclic graphs. The vertices are all the distinct recursive subproblems that arise when executing the algorithm on a particular input. There is an edge from one subproblem to another if evaluating the second subproblem requires a recursive evaluation of the first. For example, for the Fibonacci recurrence \nthe vertices of the dependency graph are the integers $0 , 1 , 2 , ldots , n$ , and the edges are the pairs $( i - 1 ) { to } i$ and $( i - 2 ) substack {  i }$ for every integer $i$ between 2 and $n$ . \nAs a more complex example, recall the recurrence for the edit distance problem from Chapter 3: \nThe dependency graph of this recurrence is an $m times n$ grid of vertices $( i , j )$ connected by vertical edges $( i - 1 , j ) { to } ( i , j )$ , horizontal edges $( i , j - 1 ) {  } ( i , j )$ , and diagonal edges $( i - 1 , j - 1 ) { to } ( i , j )$ .\u0001Dynamic programming works effic\u0001iently for any recurrence that has a r\u0001easonably small dependency graph; a proper evaluation order ensures that each subproblem is visited after its predecessors. \nAnother interesting example is the configuration graph of a game, puzzle, or mechanism like tic-tac-toe, checkers, the Rubik’s Cube, the Tower of Hanoi, or a Turing machine. The vertices of the configuration graph are all the valid configurations of the puzzle; there is an edge from one configuration to another if it is possible to transform one configuration into the other with a single simple “move”. (Obviously, the precise definition depends on what moves are allowed.) Even for reasonably simple mechanisms, the configuration graph can be extremely complex, and we typically only have access to local information about the configuration graph. \nConfiguration graphs are close relatives of the game trees we considered in Chapter 2, but with one crucial difference. Each state of a game appears exactly once in its configuration graph, but can appear many times in its game tree. In short, configuration graphs are memoized game trees! \nFinite-state automata used in formal language theory can be modeled as labeled directed graphs. Recall that a deterministic finite-state automaton is formally defined as a 5-tuple $M = ( Sigma , Q , s , A , delta )$ , where $Sigma$ is a finite set called the alphabet, $Q$ is a finite set of states, $s in Q$ is the start state, $A subseteq Q$ is the set of accepting states, and $delta colon Q times Sigma to Q$ is a transition function. But it is often more useful to think of $M$ as a directed graph $G _ { M }$ whose vertices are the states $Q$ , and whose edges have the form $q to delta ( q , a )$ for every state $q in Q$ and symbol $a in Sigma$ . Basic questions about the la\u0001nguage $L ( M )$ accepted by $M$ can then be phrased as questions about the graph $G _ { M }$ . For example, $L ( M ) = emptyset$ if and only if no accepting state/vertex is reachable from the start state/vertex s. \n\nFinally, sometimes one graph can be used to implicitly represent other larger graphs. A good example of this implicit representation is the subset construction, which is normally used to convert NFAs into DFAs, but can be applied to arbitrary directed graphs as follows. Given any directed graph $G = left( V , E right)$ , we can define a new directed graph $G ^ { prime } = ( 2 ^ { V } , E ^ { prime } )$ whose vertices are all subsets of vertices in $V$ , and whose edges $E ^ { prime }$ are defined as follows: \nWe can mechanically translate this definition into an algorithm to construct $G ^ { prime }$ from $G$ , but strictly speaking, this construction is unnecessary, because $G$ is already an implicit representation of $G ^ { prime }$ . \nIt’s important not to confuse any of these examples/representations with the actual formal definition: A graph is a pair of sets $( V , E )$ , where $V$ is an arbitrary non-empty finite set, and $E$ is a set of pairs (either ordered or unordered) of elements of $V$ . In short: A graph is a set of pairs of things. \n5.4 Data Structures \nIn practice, graphs are usually represented by one of two standard data structures: adjacency lists and adjacency matrices. At a high level, both data structures are arrays indexed by vertices; this requires that each vertex has a unique integer identifier between 1 and $V$ . In a formal sense, these integers are the vertices. \nAdjacency Lists \nBy far the most common data structure for storing graphs is the adjacency list. An adjacency list is an array of lists, each containing the neighbors of one of the vertices (or the out-neighbors if the graph is directed).6 For undirected graphs, each edge $u nu$ is stored twice, once in u’s neighbor list and once in v’s neighbor list; for directed graphs, each edge $u {  } nu$ is stored only once, in the neighbor list of the tail $u$ . For both types of gr\u0001aphs, the overall space required for an adjacency list is $O ( V + E )$ .",

For both types of gr\u0001aphs, the overall space required for an adjacency list is $O ( V + E )$ . \nThere are several different ways to represent these neighbor lists, but the standard implementation uses a simple singly-linked list. The resulting data structure allows us to list the (out-)neighbors of a node $nu$ in $O ( 1 + deg ( nu ) )$ time; just scan v’s neighbor list. Similarly, we can determine whether $u {  } nu$ is an edge in $O ( 1 + deg ( u ) )$ time by scanning the neighbor list of $u$ . For undir\u0001ected graphs, we can improve the time to $O ( 1 + operatorname* { m i n } { deg ( u ) , deg ( nu ) } )$ by simultaneously scanning the neighbor lists of both $u$ and $nu$ , stopping either when we locate the edge or when we fall of the end of a list. \nOf course, linked lists are not the only data structure we could use; any other structure that supports searching, listing, insertion, and deletion will do. For example, we can reduce the time to determine whether uv is an edge to $O ( 1 + log ( deg ( u ) ) )$ by using a balanced binary search tree to store the neighbors of $u$ , or even to $O ( 1 )$ time by using an appropriately constructed hash table.7 \nOne common implementation of adjacency lists is the adjacency array, which uses a single array to store all edge records, with the records of edges incident to each vertex in a contiguous interval, and with a separate array storing the index of the first edge incident to each vertex. Moreover, it is useful to keep the intervals for each vertex in sorted order, as shown in Figure 5.10, so that we can check in $O ( log mathrm { d e g } ( u ) )$ time whether two vertices $u$ and $nu$ are adjacent. \nAdjacency Matrices \nThe other standard data structure for graphs is the adjacency matrix,8 first proposed by Georges Brunel in $1 8 9 4$ . The adjacency matrix of a graph $G$ is a $V times V$ matrix of 0s and 1s, normally represented by a two-dimensional array $A [ 1 ldots V , 1 ldots V ]$ , where each entry indicates whether a particular edge is present in $G$ . Specifically, for all vertices $u$ and $nu$ : \n• if the graph is undirected, then $A [ u , nu ] : = 1$ if and only if $u nu in E$ , and • if the graph is directed, then $A [ u , nu ] : = 1$ if and only if $u {  } nu in E$ .",

For directed graphs, the adjacency matrix may or may not be symmetric, and the diagonal entries may or may not be zero. \nGiven an adjacency matrix, we can decide in $Theta ( 1 )$ time whether two vertices are connected by an edge just by looking in the appropriate slot in the matrix. We can also list all the neighbors of a vertex in $Theta ( V )$ time by scanning the corresponding row (or column). This running time is optimal in the worst case, but even if a vertex has few neighbors, we still have to scan the entire row to find them all. Similarly, adjacency matrices require $Theta ( V ^ { 2 } )$ space, regardless of how many edges the graph actually has, so they are only space-efficient for very dense graphs. \nComparison \nTable 5.1 summarizes the performance of the various standard graph data structures. Stars∗ indicate expected amortized time bounds for maintaining dynamic hash tables.9 \nIn light of this comparison, one might reasonably wonder why anyone would ever use an adjacency matrix; after all, adjacency lists with hash tables support the same operations in the same time, using less space. The main reason is that for sufficiently dense graphs, adjacency matrices are simpler and more efficient in practice, because they avoid the overhead of chasing pointers and computing hash functions; they’re just contiguous blocks of memory. \nSimilarly, why would anyone use linked lists in an adjacency list structure to store neighbors, instead of balanced binary search trees or hash tables? Although the primary reason in practice is almost surely tradition—If they were good enough for Donald Knuth’s code, they should be good enough for yours!—there are more principled arguments. One is that standard adjacency lists are in fact good enough for most applications. Most standard graph algorithms never (or rarely) actually ask whether an arbitrary edge is present or absent, or attempt to insert or delete edges, and so optimizing the data structures to support those operations is unnecessary. \nBut in my opinion, the most compelling reason for both standard data structures is that many graphs are implicitly represented by adjacency matrices and standard adjacency lists. For example: \n• Intersection graphs are usually represented as a list of the underlying geometric objects. As long as we can test whether two objects intersect in constant time, we can apply any graph algorithm to an intersection graph by pretending that the input graph is stored explicitly as an adjacency matrix. • Any data structure composed from records with pointers between them can be seen as a directed graph. Graph algorithms can be applied to these data structures by pretending that the graph is stored in a standard adjacency list.",

(Is there a pointer from this record to that record? Can we get from this configuration to that configuration in one move?) Moreover, we usually don’t have the luxury of reorganizing the pointers in each record or the moves out of a given configuration into a more efficient data structure. Thus, a standard adjacency list, with neighbors stored in linked lists, is the appropriate model data structure. \nIn the rest of this book, unless explicitly stated otherwise, all time bounds for graph algorithms assume that the input graph is represented by a standard adjacency list. Similarly, unless explicitly stated otherwise, when an exercise asks you to design and analyze a graph algorithm, you should assume that the input graph is represented in a standard adjacency list. \n5.5 Whatever-First Search \nSo far we have only discussed local operations on graphs; arguably the most fundamental global question we can ask about graphs is reachability. Given a graph $G$ and a vertex s in $G$ , the reachability question asks which vertices are reachable from $s$ ; that is, for which vertices $nu$ is there a path from $s$ to $nu ?$ For now, let’s consider only undirected graphs; I’ll consider directed graphs briefly at the end of this section. For undirected graphs, the vertices reachable from s are precisely the vertices in the same component as $s$ . \nPerhaps the most natural reachability algorithm—at least for people like us who are used to thinking recursively—is depth-first search. This algorithm can be written either recursively or iteratively. It’s exactly the same algorithm either way; the only difference is that we can actually see the “recursion” stack in the non-recursive version.",

We will consider several important properties and applications of depth-first search in Chapter 6. \n\nQueue: Breadth-First \nIf we implement the “bag” using a queue, we get a different graph-traversal algorithm called breadth-first search. Queues support insertions (push) and deletions (pull) in $O ( 1 )$ time each, so the algorithm runs in $O ( V + E )$ time. In this case, the breadth-first spanning tree formed by the parent edges contains shortest paths from the start vertex $s$ to every other vertex in its component; we will consider shortest paths in detail in Chapter 8. Again, the exact shape of a breadth-first spanning tree depends on the start vertex and on the order that neighbors are visited in the for loop $( dag )$ , but in general, breadth-first spanning trees are short and bushy. \nPriority Queue: Best-First \nFinally, if we implement the “bag” using a priority queue, we get yet another family of algorithms called best-first search. Because the priority queue stores at most one copy of each edge, inserting an edge or extracting the minimumpriority edge requires $O ( log E )$ time, which implies that best-first search runs in $O ( V + E log E )$ time. \nI describe best-first search as a “family of algorithms”, rather than a single algorithm, because there are different methods to assign priorities to the edges, and these choices lead to different algorithmic behavior. I’ll describe three well-known variants below, but there are many others. In all three examples, we assume that every edge $u nu$ or $u {  } nu$ in the input graph has a non-negative weight $w ( u nu )$ or $w ( u to nu )$ . \nFirst, if the input\u0001graph is undirected and we use the weight of each edge as its priority, best-first search constructs the minimum spanning tree of the component of s. Surprisingly, as long as all the edge weights are distinct, the resulting tree does not depend on the start vertex or the order that neighbors are visited; in this case, the minimum spanning tree is actually unique. This instantiation of best-first search is commonly (but, as usual, incorrectly) known as Prim’s algorithm; we’ll discuss this and other minimum-spanning-trees in more detail in Chapter 7.",

To visit every vertex in $G$ , we can use the following simple “wrapper” function. \nWait, I hear you ask, why are you making this so complicated? Why not just10 scan the vertex array? \nWell, sure, if you have an complete list of vertices, then you can do that, but remember that not all graphs are represented so explicitly.11 More importantly, even if we do have an explicit vertex list, the order in which this naive algorithm visits vertices is determined by their order in the data structure, not by the abstract structure of the graph. \nIn particular, unlike a naive scan through the vertices, WFSAll visits all the vertices in one component, and then all the vertices in the next component, and so on through each component of the input graph. This component-bycomponent traversal allows us, for example, to count the components of a disconnected graph using a single counter. \nWith just a bit more work, we can record which component contains each vertex, instead of merely marking it. \nWFSAll marks every vertex once, puts every edge into the bag once, and takes every edge out of the bag once, so the overall running time is $O ( V + E T )$ , where $T$ is the time for a bag operation. In particular, if we run depth-first search or breadth-first search at every vertex, the resulting algorithm still requires only $O ( V + E )$ time. \nMoreover, because WhateverFirstSearch computes a spanning tree of one component, we can use WFSAll to compute a spanning forest of the entire graph. In particular, best-first search with edge weights as priorities computes the minimum-weight spanning forest in $O ( V + E log E )$ . \n\nShockingly, at least one extremely popular algorithms textbook claims that this wrapper can only be used with depth-first search.12 This claim is flatly incorrect. In fact, the very first implementation of breadth-first search, written around 1945 by Konrad Zuse in his proto-language Plankalkül, was developed for the specific purpose of counting and labeling the components of an undirected graph. \nDirected Graphs \nWhatever-first search is easy to adapt to directed graphs; the only difference is that when we mark a vertex, we put all of its out-neighbors into the bag. In fact, if we are using standard adjacency lists or adjacency matrices, we do not have to change the code at all! \nOur earlier proof implies that the algorithm marks every vertex reachable from s, and the directed edges parent $( nu ) {  } p$ define a rooted tree, with all edges directed away from the root s. However,\u0001even if the graph is connected, we no longer necessarily obtain a spanning tree of the graph, because reachability is no longer symmetric. \nOn the gripping hand, WhateverFirstSearch does define a spanning tree of the vertices reachable from s. Moreover, by varying the instantiation of the “bag”, we can obtain a depth-first spanning tree, a breadth-first spanning tree, a minimum-weight directed spanning tree, a shortest-path tree, or a widest-path tree of those reachable vertices. \n5.7 Graph Reductions: Flood Fill \nOne of the earliest modern examples of whatever-first search was proposed by Edward Moore in the mid-1950s. A pixel map is a two-dimensional array whose value represent colors; the individual entries in the array are called pixels, an abbreviation of picture elements.13 A connected region in a pixel map is a connected subset of pixels that all have the same color, where two pixels are considered adjacent if they are immediate horizontal or vertical neighbors. The flood fill operation, commonly represented by a paint can in raster-graphics editing software, changes every pixel in a connected region to a new color; the input to the operation consists of the indices $i$ and $j$ of one pixel in the target region and the new color.",

The flood fill operation, commonly represented by a paint can in raster-graphics editing software, changes every pixel in a connected region to a new color; the input to the operation consists of the indices $i$ and $j$ of one pixel in the target region and the new color. \n\nThe flood-fill problem can be reduced to the reachability problem by chasing the definitions. We define an undirected graph $G = left( V , E right)$ , whose vertices are the individual pixels, and whose edges connect neighboring pixels with the same color. Each connected region in the pixel map is a component of $G$ ; thus, the flood-fill problem reduces to a reachability problem in $G$ . We can solve this reachability problem using whatever-first search in $G$ , starting at the given pixel $( i , j )$ , with one minor modification; whenever we mark a vertex, we immediately change its color. For an $n times n$ pixel map, the graph $G$ has $n ^ { 2 }$ vertices and at most $2 n ^ { 2 }$ edges, so whatever-first search runs in $O ( V + E ) = O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time. \nThis simple example demonstrates the essential ingredients of a reduction. Rather than solving the flood-fill problem from scratch, we use an existing algorithm as a black-box subroutine. How whatever-first search works is utterly irrelevant here; all that matters is its specification: Given a graph $G$ and a starting vertex s, mark every vertex in $G$ that is reachable from s. Like any other subroutine, we still have to describe how to construct the input and how to use its output. We also have to analyze our resulting algorithm in terms of our input parameters, not the vertices and edges of whatever intermediate graph our algorithm constructs. \nNow that we have an algorithm that works—but only now—we can apply two easy optimizations to make it faster, one practical and the other theoretical: \n• In an actual implementation, we would not actually build a separate graph data structure for $G$ . Instead, we can use the pixel map directly as though it were a standard adjacency list, because we can list the same-color neighbors of any pixel in $O ( 1 )$ time each. In particular, there is no need to separately “mark” vertices; we can use the color of the pixels instead. • More careful analysis implies that the running time is proportional to the number of pixels in the region being filled—equivalently, the number of vertices in component of $G$ containing vertex $( i , j )$ —which could be considerably smaller than $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ . \nExercises \nGraphs \n1. Prove that the following definitions are all equivalent. \n• A tree is a connected acyclic graph.   \n• A tree is one component of a forest. (A forest is an acyclic graph.)   \n• A tree is a connected graph with at most $V - 1$ edges.   \n• A tree is a minimally connected graph; removing any edge disconnects the graph.   \n• A tree is an acyclic graph with at least $V - 1$ edges.   \n• A tree is a maximally acyclic graph; adding an edge between any two vertices creates a cycle.   \n• A tree is a graph that contains a unique path between each pair of vertices. \n2. Prove that any connected acyclic graph with $n geq 2$ vertices has at least two vertices with degree 1. Do not use the words “tree” or “leaf”, or any well-known properties of trees; your proof should follow entirely from the definitions of “connected” and “acyclic”. \n3. A graph $( V , E )$ is bipartite if the vertices $V$ can be partitioned into two subsets $L$ and $R$ , such that every edge has one vertex in $L$ and the other in $R$ . \n(a) Prove that every tree is a bipartite graph.   \n(b) Prove that a graph $G$ is bipartite if and only if every cycle in $G$ has an even number of edges.   \n(c) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm that determines whether a given undirected graph is bipartite.",

Whenever groups of pigeons gather, they instinctively establish a pecking order. For any pair of pigeons, one pigeon always pecks the other, driving it away from food or potential mates. The same pair of pigeons always chooses the same pecking order, even after years of separation, no matter what other pigeons are around. Surprisingly, the overall pecking order can contain cycles—for example, pigeon i pecks pigeon $j$ , which pecks pigeon $k$ , which pecks pigeon $ell$ , which pecks pigeon i. \n(a) Prove that any finite population of pigeons can be placed in a procession (perhaps a parade?) so that each pigeon pecks the preceding pigeon’s posterior. Pretty please.   \n(b) Suppose you are given a directed graph representing the pecking relationships among a set of $n$ pigeons.

Two vertices are joined by an edge if their labels differ in exactly one bit. \n(a) A Hamiltonian cycle in a graph $G$ is a cycle of edges in $G$ that enters each vertex of $G$ exactly once.

[Hint: This is very easy.] \nTraversal Algorithms \n7. Recall that a directed graph $G$ is strongly connected if, for any two vertices $u$ and $nu$ , there is a path in $G$ from $u$ to $nu$ and a path in $G$ from $nu$ to $u$ . \nDescribe an algorithm to determine, given an undirected graph $G$ as input, whether it is possible to direct each edge of $G$ so that the resulting directed graph is strongly connected. \n8. Let $G$ be a connected graph, and let $T$ be a depth-first spanning tree of $G$ rooted at some node $nu$ . Prove that if $T$ is also a breadth-first spanning tree of $G$ rooted at $nu$ , then $G = T$ . \n9. Professors Epprich and Goodstein propose the following optimization of the generic whatever-first search algorithm. Instead of checking whether the vertices we take out of the bag are marked, their algorithm checks before it even puts the vertex into the bag, thereby ensuring that each vertex is put into the bag at most once. Their algorithm also assigns the parent of each vertex when that vertex is marked. \n(a) Prove that EagerWFS(s) marks every node reachable from s and nothing else. Equivalently, prove that the parent edges $nu {  } p a r e n t ( nu )$ computed by EagerWFS(s) define a spanning tree of the co\u0001mponent containing $s$ .   \n(b) Prove that if the bag is implemented as a queue, EagerWFS is equivalent to breadth-first search, meaning the two algorithms mark the same vertices in the same order and construct the same spanning tree. [Hint: What is the definition of a queue?]   \n(c) Prove that EagerWFS is never equivalent to depth-first search, no matter what data structure is used as the bag (and thus, in particular, when the bag is a stack). \nNeither EagerWFS nor RecursiveDFS specify the order that edges vw at each vertex $nu$ are considered, and different edge orders may lead to different spanning trees. Thus, you need to argue, for some explicit graph $G$ , that no spanning tree of $G$ produced by RecursiveDFS can be constructed by EagerWFS (using any bag data structure), or vice versa. \n10. One of the earliest published descriptions of whatever-first search as a generic class of algorithms was by Edsger Dijkstra, Leslie Lamport, Alain Martin, Carel Scholten, and Elisabeth Steffens in 1975, as part of the design of an automatic garbage collector. Instead of maintaining marked and unmarked vertices, their algorithm maintains a color for each vertex, which is either white, gray, or black. As usual, in the following algorithm, we imagine a fixed underlying graph $G$ . \n(a) Prove that ThreeColorSearch maintains the following invariant at all times: No black vertex is a neighbor of a white vertex. [Hint: This should be easy.]   \n(b) Prove that after ThreeColorSearch(s) terminates, all vertices reachable from s are black, all vertices not reachable from s are white, and that the parent edges $nu {  } p a r e n t ( nu )$ define a rooted spanning tree of the component containing s\u0001. [Hint: Intuitively, black nodes are “marked” and gray nodes are “in the bag”. Unlike our formulation of WhateverFirstSearch, however, the three-color algorithm is not required to process all edges out of a node at the same time.]   \n(c) Prove that the following variant of ThreeColorSearch, which maintains the set of gray vertices in a standard stack, is equivalent to depth-first search. [Hint: The order of the last two lines of ThreeColorStackStep matters!] \n(d) Prove that the following variant of ThreeColorSearch, which maintains the set of gray vertices in a standard queue, is not equivalent to breadth-first search. [Hint: The order of the last two lines of ThreeColorQueueStep doesn’t matter!] \n\nn(e) Now suppose that another process is adding edges to $G$ while ThreeColorSearch is running. These new edges could violate the color invariant described in part (a) and therefore destroy the correctness of the algorithm—in particular, when ThreeColorSearch terminates, some vertices reachable from s could be white. This would be disastrous if we are relying on “white” to mean “unreachable and therefore safe to delete”. \nHowever, if the other process explicitly preserves the color invariant, we can still use the three-color algorithm to safely identify unreachable vertices. We model the two concurrent algorithms as follows; the either/or choice in GarbageCollect and the choice of which vertices $u$ and w to Mutate are entirely out of the main algorithm’s control.14 \nProve that GarbageCollect eventually terminates with every vertex reachable from s colored black and every vertex not reachable from s colored white. \nn(f) Suppose instead of recoloring black vertices gray, Mutate maintains the color invariant by coloring some white vertices gray: \nProve that GarbageCollect eventually terminates with s colored black, every vertex reachable from a black vertex colored black, and every vertex not reachable from a black vertex colored white. \nReductions \n11. A number maze is an $n times n$ grid of positive integers. A token starts in the upper left corner; your goal is to move the token to the lower-right corner. On each turn, you are allowed to move the token up, down, left, or right; the distance you may move the token is determined by the number on its current square. For example, if the token is on a square labeled 3, then you may move the token three steps up, three steps down, three steps left, or three steps right. However, you are never allowed to move the token off the edge of the board. \nDescribe and analyze an efficient algorithm that either returns the minimum number of moves required to solve a given number maze, or correctly reports that the maze has no solution. For example, given the number maze in Figure 5.14, your algorithm should return the integer 8. \n12. Snakes and Ladders is a classic board game, originating in India no later than the 16th century. The board consists of an $n times n$ grid of squares, numbered consecutively from 1 to $n ^ { 2 }$ , starting in the bottom left corner and proceeding row by row from bottom to top, with rows alternating to the left and right. Certain pairs of squares in this grid, always in different rows, are connected by either “snakes” (leading down) or “ladders” (leading up). Each square can be an endpoint of at most one snake or ladder. \n\nYou start with a token in cell 1, in the bottom left corner. In each move, you advance your token up to $k$ positions, for some fixed constant $k$ . If the token ends the move at the top end of a snake, it slides down to the bottom of that snake. Similarly, if the token ends the move at the bottom end of a ladder, it climbs up to the top of that ladder. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to compute the smallest number of moves required for the token to reach the last square of the grid. \n0 99 98 97 96 95 94 93 92 91   \n8 82 8 3 84 85 86 87 88 89 90   \n80 79 7 8 7 76 5 4 73 72 71   \n61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70   \n60 59 58 57 56 55 54 53 52 51   \n41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50   \n40 39 38 37 36 35 34 33 32 31   \n21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   \n20 9 8 17 16 5 14 3 2 1   \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n13. The infamous Mongolian puzzle-warrior Vidrach Itky Leda invented the following puzzle in the year 1473. The puzzle consists of an $n times n$ grid of squares, where each square is labeled with a positive integer, and two tokens, one red and the other blue. The tokens always lie on distinct squares of the grid. The tokens start in the top left and bottom right corners of the grid; the goal of the puzzle is to swap the tokens. \nIn a single turn, you may move either token up, right, down, or left by a distance determined by the other token. For example, if the red token is on a square labeled 3, then you may move the blue token 3 steps up, 3 steps left, 3 steps right, or 3 steps down. However, you may not move either token off the grid, and at the end of a move the two tokens cannot lie on the same square. \nDescribe and analyze an efficient algorithm that either returns the minimum number of moves required to solve a given Vidrach Itky Leda puzzle, or correctly reports that the puzzle has no solution. For example, given the puzzle in Figure 5.16, your algorithm would return the number 5. \n14. Suppose you are given a directed graph $G = ( V , E )$ and two vertices $s$ and $t$ . Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine if there is a walk in $G$ from s to $t$ (possibly repeating vertices and/or edges) whose length is divisible by 3. \nFor example, given the graph shown below, with the indicated vertices $s$ and $t$ , your algorithm should return True, because the walk $s {  } w {  } y {  } x {  } s {  } w {  } t$ has length 6. \n15. Suppose you are given a directed graph $G$ where some edges are red and the remaining edges are blue. Describe an algorithm to find the shortest walk in $G$ from one vertex s to another vertex $t$ in which no three consecutive edges have the same color. That is, if the walk contains two red edges in a row, the next edge must be blue, and if the walk contains two blue edges in a row, the next edge must be red. \nFor example, given the following graph as input, your algorithm should return the integer 7, because $s {  a  b Rightarrow d  c Rightarrow a  b  t$ is the shortest legal walk from $s$ to $t$ . \n16. Consider a directed graph $G$ , where each edge is colored either red, white, or blue. A walk in $G$ is called a French flag walk if its sequence of edge colors is red, white, blue, red, white, blue, and so on. More formally, a walk $nu _ { 0 } {  } nu _ { 1 } {  } cdots {  } nu _ { k }$ is a French flag walk if, for every integer $i$ , the edge $nu _ { i } {  } nu _ { i + 1 }$ is r\u0001ed i\u0001f i mo\u0001d $3 = 0$ , white if $i$ mod $3 = 1$ , and blue if i mod $3 = 2$ . \nDescribe an algorithm to find all vertices in $G$ that can be reached from a given vertex $nu$ through a French flag walk. \n17. There are $n$ galaxies connected by $m$ intergalactic teleport-ways. Each teleport-way joins two galaxies and can be traversed in both directions. Also, each teleport-way e has an associated cost of $c ( e )$ dollars, where $c ( e )$ is a positive integer. A teleport-way can be used multiple times, but the toll must be paid every time it is used. \nJudy wants to travel from galaxy s to galaxy $t$ , but teleportation is not very pleasant and she would like to minimize the number of times she needs to teleport. However, she wants the total cost to be a multiple of five dollars, because carrying small change is not pleasant either. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the smallest number of times Judy needs to teleport to travel from galaxy $s$ to galaxy $t$ so that the total cost is a multiple of five dollars.   \n(b) Solve part (a), but now assume that Judy has a coupon that allows her to use exactly one teleport-way for free. \n18. Three Seashells is a solitaire game, played on a connected undirected graph G. Initially, three tokens are placed on distinct start vertices $a , b , c$ . In each turn, you must move all three tokens, by moving each token along an edge from its current vertex to an adjacent vertex. At the end of each turn, the three tokens must lie on three different vertices. Your goal is to move the tokens onto three goal vertices $x , y , z$ ; it does not matter which token ends up on which goal vertex. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether a given Three Seashells puzzle is solvable. Your input consists of the graph $G$ , the start vertices $a , b , c _ { . }$ , and the goal vertices $x , y , z$ . Your output is a single bit: True or False. \n19. Let $G$ be a connected undirected graph. Suppose we start with two coins on two arbitrarily chosen vertices of $G$ , and we want to move the coins so that they lie on the same vertex using as few moves as possible. At every step, each coin must move to an adjacent vertex. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum number of steps to reach a configuration where both coins are on the same vertex, or to report correctly that no such configuration is reachable. The input to your algorithm consists of a graph $G = left( V , E right)$ and two vertices u, $nu in V$ (which may or may not be distinct).   \n(b) Now suppose there are three coins. Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum number of steps to reach a configuration where both coins are on the same vertex, or to report correctly that no such configuration is reachable.   \n(c) Finally, suppose there are forty-two coins. Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether it is possible to move all 42 coins to the same vertex. Again, every coin must move at every step. For full credit, your algorithm should run in $O ( V + E )$ time. \n20. One of my daughter’s elementary-school math workbooks15 contains several puzzles of the following type: \nComplete each angle maze below by tracing a path from start to finish that has only acute angles. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to solve arbitrary acute-angle mazes. \nYou are given a connected undirected graph $G$ , whose vertices are points in the plane and whose edges are line segments. Edges do not intersect, except at their endpoints. For example, a drawing of the letter X would have five vertices and four edges, and the first maze above has 18 vertices and 21 edges. You are also given two vertices Start and Finish. \nYour algorithm should return True if $G$ contains a walk from Start to Finish that has only acute angles, and False otherwise. Formally, a walk through $G$ is valid if, for any two consecutive edges $u {  } nu {  } w$ in the walk, either $angle u nu w = pi$ or $0 < angle u nu w < pi / 2$ . Assume you have\u0001a\u0001subroutine that can determine in $O ( 1 )$ time whether the angle between two given segments is straight, obtuse, right, or acute. \n21. Suppose you are given a set of $n$ horizontal and vertical line segments and two points $s$ and $t$ in the plane. Describe an efficient algorithm to determine if there is a path from $s$ to $t$ that does not intersect any of the given line segments. \nEach horizontal line segment is specified by its left and right $x$ -coordinates and its unique $y$ -coordinate; similarly, each vertical line segment is specified by its unique $x$ -coordinate and its top and bottom $y$ -coordinates. Finally, the points s and $t$ are each specified by their $x$ - and $y$ -coordinates. \n22. Every cheesy romance movie has a scene where the romantic couple, after a long and frustrating separation, suddenly see each other across a long distance, and then slowly approach one another with unwavering eye contact as the music rolls in and the rain lifts and the sun shines through the clouds and the music swells and everyone starts dancing with rainbows and kittens and chocolate unicorns and. . . .16 \nSuppose a romantic couple—in grand computer science tradition, named Alice and Bob—enters their favorite park at the east and west entrances and immediately establish eye-contact. They can’t just run directly to each other; instead, they must stay on the path that zig-zags through the park between the east and west entrances. To maintain the proper dramatic tension, Alice and Bob must traverse the path so that they always lie on a direct east-west line. \nWe can describe the zigzag path as two arrays $X [ 0 ldots n ]$ and $Y [ 0 ldots n ]$ , containing the $x$ - and $y$ -coordinates of the corners of the path, in order from the southwest endpoint to the southeast endpoint. The $X$ array is sorted in increasing order, and $Y [ 0 ] = Y [ n ]$ . The path is a sequence of straight line segments connecting these corners. \n(a) Suppose $Y [ 0 ] = Y [ n ] = 0$ and $Y [ i ] > 0$ for every other index $i$ ; that is, the endpoints of the path are strictly below every other point on the path. \nProve that for any path $P$ meeting these conditions, Alice and Bob can always meet. [Hint: Describe a graph that models all possible locations of the couple along the path. What are the vertices of this graph? What are the edges? Use the Handshake Lemma: Every graph has an even number of vertices with odd degree.] \n(b) If the endpoints of the path are not below every other vertex, Alice and Bob might still be able to meet, or they might not. Describe an algorithm to decide whether Alice and Bob can meet, without either breaking east-west eye contact or stepping off the path, given the arrays $X [ 0 ldots n ]$ and $Y [ 0 ldots n ]$ as input. \nn(c) Describe an algorithm for part (b) that runs in $O ( n )$ time. \n23. The famous puzzle-maker Kaniel the Dane invented a solitaire game played with two tokens on an $n times n$ square grid. Some squares of the grid are marked as obstacles, and one grid square is marked as the target. In each turn, the player must move one of the tokens from is current position as far as possible upward, downward, right, or left, stopping just before the token hits (1) the edge of the board, (2) an obstacle square, or (3) the other token. The goal is to move either of the tokens onto the target square. \nFor example, we can solve the puzzle shown in Figure 5.20 by moving the red token down until it hits the obstacle, then moving the green token left until it hits the red token, and then moving the red token left, down, right, and up. The red token stops at the target on the 6th move because the green token is just above the target square. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether an instance of this puzzle is solvable. Your input consist of the integer $n$ , a list of obstacle locations, the target location, and the initial locations of the tokens. The output of your algorithm is a single boolean: True if the given puzzle is solvable and False otherwise. [Hint: Don’t forget about the time required to construct the graph.] \n\nn24. Rectangle Walk is a new abstract puzzle game, available for only $9 9 Phi$ on Steam, iOS, Android, Xbox One, Playstation 5, Nintendo Wii U, Atari 2600, Palm Pilot, Commodore 64, TRS-80, Sinclair ZX-1, DEC PDP-8, PLATO, Zuse Z3, Duramesc, Odhner Arithmometer, Analytical Engine, Jacquard Loom, Horologium Mirabile Lundense, Leibniz Stepped Reckoner, Al-Jazari’s Robot Band, Yan Shi’s Automaton, Antikythera Mechanism, Knotted Rope, Ishango Bone, and Pile of Rocks. \nThe game is played on an $scriptstyle n times n$ grid of black and white squares. The player moves a rectangle through this grid, subject to the following conditions: \n• The rectangle must be aligned with the grid; that is, the top, bottom, left, and right coordinates must be integers.   \n• The rectangle must fit within the $n times n$ grid, and it must contain at least one grid cell.   \n• The rectangle must not contain a black square.   \n• In a single move, the player can replace the current rectangle $r$ with any rectangle $boldsymbol { r } ^ { prime }$ that either contains $r$ or is contained in $r$ . \nInitially, the player’s rectangle is a $1 times 1$ square in the upper right corner. The player’s goal is to reach a $1 times 1$ square in the bottom left corner using as few moves as possible. \n购 \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to compute the length of the shortest Rectangle Walk in a given bitmap. Your input is an array $M [ 1 ldots n , 1 ldots n ]$ , where $M [ i , j ] = 1$ indicates a black square and $M [ i , j ] = 0$ indicates a white square. Assume that a valid rectangle walk exists; in particular, $M [ 1 , 1 ] = M [ n , n ] = 0$ . For example, given the bitmap shown above, your algorithm should return the integer 18. [Hint: Don’t forget about the time required to construct the graph!!] \n25. Racetrack (also known as Graph Racers and Vector Rally) is a two-player paper-and-pencil racing game that Jeff played on the bus in 5th grade.17 The game is played with a track drawn on a sheet of graph paper. The players alternately choose a sequence of grid points that represent the motion of a car around the track, subject to certain constraints explained below. \nEach car has a position and a velocity, both with integer $x$ - and $y$ - coordinates. A subset of grid squares is marked as the starting area, and another subset is marked as the finishing area. The initial position of each car is chosen by the player somewhere in the starting area; the initial velocity of each car is always $( 0 , 0 )$ . At each step, the player optionally increments or decrements either or both coordinates of the car’s velocity; in other words, each component of the velocity can change by at most 1 in a single step. The car’s new position is then determined by adding the new velocity to the car’s previous position. The new position must be inside the track; otherwise, the car crashes and that player loses the race. The race ends when the first car reaches a position inside the finishing area. \nSuppose the racetrack is represented by an $n times n$ array of bits, where each 0 bit represents a grid point inside the track, each 1 bit represents a grid point outside the track, the “starting area” is the first column, and the “finishing area” is the last column. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to find the minimum number of steps required to move a car from the starting line to the finish line of a given racetrack. \n26. A rolling die maze is a puzzle involving a standard six-sided die (a cube with numbers on each side) and a grid of squares. You should imagine the grid lying on a table; the die always rests on and exactly covers one square of the grid. In a single step, you can roll the die 90 degrees around one of its bottom edges, moving it to an adjacent square one step north, south, east, or west. \nSome squares in the grid may be blocked; the die can never rest on a blocked square. Other squares may be labeled with a number; whenever the die rests on a labeled square, the number on the top face of the die must equal the label. Squares that are neither labeled nor marked are free. You may not roll the die off the edges of the grid. A rolling die maze is solvable if it is possible to place a die on the lower left square and roll it to the upper right square under these constraints. \nFigure 5.24 shows four rolling die mazes. Assuming we use a standard die with 1 and 6 on opposite sides, only the first two mazes are solvable. For example, the first maze is solvable by by placing the die on the lower left square with 1 on the top face, and then rolling the die east, then north, then north, then east. \n(a) Suppose the input is a two-dimensional array $L [ 1 ldots n , 1 ldots n ]$ , where each entry $boldsymbol { L } [ i , j ]$ stores the label of the square in the ith row and $j$ th column, where 0 means the square is free and $- 1$ means the square is blocked. \nDescribe and analyze a polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether the given rolling die maze is solvable. \nn(b) Now suppose the maze is specified implicitly by a list of labeled and blocked squares. Specifically, suppose the input consists of an integer $M$ , specifying the height and width of the maze, and an array $S [ 1 ldots n ]$ , where each entry $s [ i ]$ is a triple $( x , y , L )$ indicating that square $( x , y )$ has label $L$ . As in the explicit encoding, label $- 1$ indicates that the square is blocked; free squares are not listed in $s$ at all. Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to determine whether the given rolling die maze is solvable. For full credit, the running time of your algorithm should be polynomial in the input size $n$ . \n[Hint: You have some freedom in how to place the initial die. There are rolling die mazes that can be solved only if the initial position is chosen correctly.] \nn27. Suppose you are given an arbitrary directed graph $G$ in which each edge is colored either red or blue, along with two special vertices s and $t$ . \n(a) Describe an algorithm that either computes a walk from s to $t$ such that the pattern of red and blue edges along the walk is a palindrome, or correctly reports that no such walk exists.   \n(b) Describe an algorithm that either computes the shortest walk from s to t such that the pattern of red and blue edges along the walk is a palindrome, or correctly reports that no such walk exists. \n[Hint: Where did we last see palindromes?] $^ bullet _ { 2 8 }$ . Draughts, also known in the United States as “checkers”, is a game played on an $m times m$ grid of squares, alternately colored light and dark.18 The game is usually played on an $8 times 8$ or $1 0 times 1 0$ board, but the rules easily generalize to any board size. Each dark square is occupied by at most one game piece (usually called a checker in the U.S.), which is either black or white; light squares are always empty. One player (“White”) moves the white pieces; the other (“Black”) moves the black pieces. A player loses when her last piece is taken off the board. \n\nConsider the following simple version of the game, essentially American checkers or British draughts, but where every piece is a king.19 Pieces can be moved in any of the four diagonal directions. On each turn, a player either moves one of her pieces one step diagonally into an empty square, or makes a series of jumps with one of her pieces. In each jump, the piece moves to an empty square two steps away in any diagonal direction, but only if the intermediate square is occupied by a piece of the opposite color; this enemy piece is captured and immediately removed from the board. All jumps in the same turn must be made with the same piece. \nDescribe an algorithm to decide whether White can capture every black piece, thereby winning the game, in a single turn. The input consists of the width of the board $( m )$ , a list of positions of white pieces, and a list of positions of black pieces. For full credit, your algorithm should run in $O ( n )$ time, where $n$ is the total number of pieces. [Hint: The greedy strategy—make arbitrary jumps until you get stuck—does not always find a winning sequence of jumps even when one exists. See problem 5. Parity, parity, parity.] \nAnd, for the hous is crinkled to and fro, And hath so queinte weyes for to go— For hit is shapen as the mase is wroght— Therto have I a remedie in my thoght, That, by a clewe of twyne, as he hath goon, The same wey he may returne anoon, Folwing alwey the threed, as he hath come. \n— Geoffrey Chaucer, The Legend of Good Women (c. 1385) \n“Com’è bello il mondo e come sono brutti i labirinti!” dissi sollevato. “Come sarebbe bello il mondo se ci fosse una regola per girare nei labirinti,” rispose il mio maestro. \n[“How beautiful the world is, and how ugly labyrinths are,” I said, relieved. “How beautiful the world would be if there were a procedure for moving through labyrinths,” my master replied.] \n— Umberto Eco, Il nome della rosa (1980) English translation (The Name of the Rose) by William Weaver (1983) \nDepth-First Search \nIn the previous chapter, we considered a generic algorithm—whatever-first search—for traversing arbitrary graphs, both undirected and directed.

        "content": "In either formulation, this algorithm assigns assigns v.pre (and advances the clock) just after pushing $nu$ onto the recursion stack, and it assigns v.post (and advances the clock) just before popping $nu$ off the recursion stack. It follows that for any two vertices $u$ and $nu$ , the intervals $left[ u . p r e , u . p o s t right]$ and $[ nu . p r e , nu . p o s t ]$ are either disjoint or nested. Moreover, $left[ u . p r e , u . p o s t right]$ contains $left[ nu . p r e , nu . p o s t right]$ if and only if $mathrm { D F S } ( nu )$ is called during the execution of $mathrm { D F S } ( u )$ , or equivalently, if and only if $u$ is an ancestor of $nu$ in the final forest of parent pointers. \nAfter DFSAll labels every node in the graph, the labels $nu$ .pre define a preordering of the vertices, and the labels $nu$ .post define a postordering of the vertices.2 With a few trivial exceptions, every graph has several different preand postorderings, depending on the order that DFS considers edges leaving each vertex, and the order that DFSAll considers vertices. \nFor the rest of this chapter, we refer to $nu$ .pre as the starting time of $nu$ (or less formally, “when $nu$ starts”), $nu$ .post as the finishing time of $nu$ (or less formally, “when $nu$ finishes”), and the interval between the starting and finishing times as the active interval of $nu$ (or less formally, “while $nu$ is active”). \nClassifying Vertices and Edges \nDuring the execution of DFSAll, each vertex $nu$ of the input graph has one of three states: \n• new if $mathrm { D F S } ( nu )$ has not been called, that is, if clock $< nu$ .pre; • active if $mathrm { D F S } ( nu )$ has been called but has not returned, that is, if $nu . p r e leq$ clock $< nu$ .post; • finished if $mathrm { D F S } ( nu )$ has returned, that is, if $nu . p o s t leq c l o c k$ . \nBecause starting and finishing times correspond to pushes and pops on the recursion stack, a vertex is active if and only if it is on the recursion stack. It follows that the active nodes always comprise a directed path in $G$ . \nThe edges of the input graph fall into four different classes, depending on how their active intervals intersect. Fix your favorite edge $u {  } nu$ . \n• If $nu$ is new when $mathrm { D F S } ( u )$ begins, then $mathrm { D F S } ( nu )$ must be\u0001called during the execution of $mathrm { D F S } ( u )$ , either directly or through some intermediate recursive calls. In either case, $u$ is a proper ancestor of $nu$ in the depth-first forest, and $u . p r e < nu . p r e < nu . p o s t < u . p o s t .$ – If $mathrm { D F S } ( u )$ calls $mathrm { D F S } ( nu )$ directly, then $u = nu$ .parent and $u {  } nu$ is called a tree edge. – Otherwise, $u {  } nu$ is called a forward edge.   \n• If $nu$ is active when $mathrm { D F S } ( u )$ begins, then $nu$ is already on the recursion stack, which implies the opposite nesting order $nu . p r e < u . p r e < u . p o s t < nu . p o s t$ . Moreover, $G$ must contain a directed path from $nu$ to $u$ . Edges satisfying this condition are called back edges.   \n• If $nu$ is finished when $mathrm { D F S } ( u )$ begins, we immediately have $nu . p o s t < u . p r e$ . Edges satisfying this condition are called cross edges.   \n• Finally, the fourth ordering $u . p o s t < nu . mathrm {  }$ pre is impossible. \nThese edge classes are illustrated in Figure 6.5. Again, the actual classification of edges depends on the order in which DFSAll considers vertices and the order in which DFS considers the edges leaving each vertex. \nFinally, the following key lemma characterizes ancestors and descendants in any depth-first forest according to vertex states during the traversal. \nLemma 6.1. Fix an arbitrary depth-first traversal of any directed graph G. The following statements are equivalent for all vertices u and $nu$ of G. \n(a) $u$ is an ancestor of $nu$ in the depth-first forest.   \n$( b )$ $u . p r e leq nu . p r e < nu . p o s t leq u . p o s t .$   \n(c) Just after $D F S ( nu )$ is called, $u$ is active.   \n(d) Just before ${ cal D } F S ( u )$ is called, there is a path from u to $nu$ in which every vertex (including $u$ and $nu$ ) is new. \nProof: First, suppose $u$ is an ancestor of $nu$ in the depth-first forest. Then by definition there is a path $P$ of tree edges $u$ to $nu$ . By induction on the path length, we have $u . p r e leq w . p r e < w . p o s t leq u . p o s t$ for every vertex $w$ in $P$ , and thus every vertex in $P$ is new before $mathrm { D F S } ( u )$ is called. In particular, we have $u . p r e leq nu . p r e < nu . p o s t leq u . p o s t$ , which implies that $u$ is active while $mathrm { D F S } ( nu )$ is executing. \nBecause parent pointers correspond to recursive calls, $u . p r e leq nu . p r e <$ $nu . p o s t leq u$ .post implies that $u$ is an ancestor of $nu$ . \nSuppose $u$ is active just after $mathrm { D F S } ( nu )$ is called. Then $u . p r e leq nu . p r e < nu . p o s t leq$ u.post, which implies that there is a path of (zero or more) tree edges from $u$ , through the intermediate nodes on the recursion stack (if any), to $nu$ . \nFinally, suppose $u$ is not an ancestor of $nu$ . Fix an arbitrary path $P$ from $u$ to $nu$ , let $x$ be the first vertex in $P$ that is not a descendant of $u$ , and let $w$ be the predecessor of $x$ in $P$ . The edge $w {  } x$ guarantees that $x . p r e < w . p o s t$ , and $w . p o s t < u$ .post because $w$ is a descenda\u0001nt of $u$ , so $x$ .pre $< u$ .post. It follows that $x . p r e < u .$ pre, because otherwise $x$ would be a descendant of $u$ . Because active intervals are properly nested, there are only two possibilities: \n• If $u . p o s t < x . p o s t$ , then $x$ is active when $mathrm { D F S } ( u )$ is called.   \n• If $x . p o s t < u . p t$ re, then $x$ is already finished when $mathrm { D F S } ( u )$ is called. \nWe conclude that every path from $u$ to $nu$ contains a vertex that is not new when $mathrm { D F S } ( u )$ is called. □ \n6.2 Detecting Cycles \nA directed acyclic graph or dag is a directed graph with no directed cycles. Any vertex in a dag that has no incoming vertices is called a source; any vertex with no outgoing edges is called a sink. An isolated vertex with no incident edges at all is both a source and a sink. Every dag has at least one source and one sink, but may have more than one of each.

In most applications of topological sort, the ordered list of the vertices is not our actual goal; rather, we want to perform some fixed computation at each vertex of the graph, either in topological order or in reverse topological order. For these applications, it is not necessary to record the topological order at all! \nIf we want to process a directed acyclic graph in reverse topological order, it suffices to process each vertex at the end of its recursive depth-first search. After all, topological order is the same as reversed postorder! \nPostProcessDFS(v): v.status $$ Active PostProcess(G): for all vertices v for each edge $nu {  } w$ if w.status ${ bf Lambda } = mathrm { N } { bf E } { bf w }$ v.status New PostProcessDFS(w) for all vertices $nu$ else if w.status $ c =$ Active if $nu$ is unmarked fail gracefully PostProcessDFS(v) v.status $$ Finished Process(v) \nIf we already know that the input graph is acyclic, we can further simplify the algorithm by simply marking vertices instead of recording their search status. \nPostProcessDag(G): PostProcessDagDFS(v): for all vertices v mark v unmark v for each edge $nu {  } w$ for all vertices v if w is unma\u0001rked if $nu$ is unmarked PostProcessDagDFS(w) PostProcessDagDFS(s) Process(v) \nThis is just the standard depth-first search algorithm, with PostVisit renamed to Process! \nBecause it is such a common operation on directed acyclic graphs, I sometimes express postorder processing of a dag idiomatically as follows: \nFor example, our earlier explicit topological sort algorithm can be written as follows: \nTo process a dag in forward topological order, we can record a topological ordering of the vertices into an array and then run a simple for-loop. Alternatively, we can apply depth-first search to the reversal of $G$ , denoted $r e nu ( G )$ , obtained by replacing each each $nu {  } w$ with its reversal $w {  } nu$ . Reversing a directed cycle gives us another directed\u0001cycle with the opposi\u0001te orientation, so the reversal of a dag is another dag. Every source in $G$ is a sink in $r e nu ( G )$ and vice versa; it follows inductively that every topological ordering of $r e nu ( G )$ is the reversal of a topological ordering of $G$ .3 The reversal of any directed graph (represented in a standard adjacency list) can be computed in $O ( V + E )$ time; the details of this construction are left as an easy exercise. \n6.4 Memoization and Dynamic Programming \nOur topological sort algorithm is arguably the model for a wide class of dynamic programming algorithms. Recall that the dependency graph of a recurrence has a vertex for every recursive subproblem and an edge from one subproblem to another if evaluating the first subproblem requires a recursive evaluation of the second. The dependency graph must be acyclic, or the naïve recursive algorithm would never halt. \nEvaluating any recurrence with memoization is exactly the same as performing a depth-first search of the dependency graph. In particular, a vertex of the dependency graph is “marked” if the value of the corresponding subproblem has already been computed. The black-box subroutines PreVisit and PostVisit are proxies for the actual value computation. See Figure 6.10. \nCarrying this analogy further, evaluating a recurrence using dynamic programming is the same as evaluating all subproblems in the dependency graph of the recurrence in reverse topological order—every subproblem is considered after the subproblems it depends on. Thus, every dynamic programming algorithm is equivalent to a postorder traversal of the dependency graph of its underlying recurrence!",

First, in most dynamic programming algorithms, the dependency graph is implicit—the nodes and edges are not explicitly stored in memory, but rather are encoded by the underlying recurrence. But this difference really is minor; as long as we can enumerate recursive subproblems in constant time each, we can traverse the dependency graph exactly as if it were explicitly stored in an adjacency list. \nMore significantly, most dynamic programming recurrences have highly structured dependency graphs. For example, as we discussed in Chapter 5, the dependency graph for the edit distance recurrence is a regular grid with diagonals, and the dependency graph for optimal binary search trees is an upper triangular grid with all possible rightward and upward edges. This regular structure allows us to hard-wire a suitable evaluation order directly into the algorithm, typically as a collection of nested loops, so there is no need to topologically sort the dependency graph at run time. We previously called the reverse topological order an evaluation order. \nDynamic Programming in Dags \nConversely, we can use depth-first search to build dynamic programming algorithms for problems with less structured dependency graphs. For example, consider the longest path problem, which asks for the path of maximum total weight from one node s to another node $t$ in a directed graph $G$ with weighted edges. In general directed graphs, the longest path problem is NP-hard (by an easy reduction from the traveling salesman problem; see Chapter 12), but it is easy to if the input graph $G$ is acyclic, we can compute the longest path in $G$ in linear time, as follows. \n\nFix the target vertex $t$ , and for any node $nu$ , let $L L P ( nu )$ denote the Length of the Longest Path in $G$ from $nu$ to $t$ . If $G$ is a dag, this function satisfies the recurrence \nwhere $ell ( nu {  } w )$ denotes the given weight (“length”) of edge $nu {  } w$ , and max $varnothing =$ $- infty$ . In pa\u0001rticular, if $nu$ is a sink but not equal to $t$ , then $L L P ( nu ) = - infty$ . \nThe dependency graph for this recurrence is the input graph $G$ itself: subproblem $L L P ( nu )$ depends on subproblem $L L P ( w )$ if and only if $nu {  } w$ is an edge in $G$ . Thus, we can evaluate this recursive function in $O ( V + E )$ time by performing a depth-first search of $G$ , starting at s. The algorithm memoizes each length $L L P ( nu )$ into an extra field in the corresponding node $nu$ . \nIn principle, we can transform this memoized recursive algorithm into a dynamic programming algorithm via topological sort: \nThese two algorithms are arguably identical—the recursion in the first algorithm and the for-loop in the second algorithm represent the “same” depth-first search! Choosing one of these formulations over the other is entirely a matter of convenience. \nAlmost any dynamic programming problem that asks for an optimal sequence of decisions can be recast as finding an optimal path in some associated dag. For example, the text segmentation, subset sum, longest increasing subsequence, and edit distance problems we considered in Chapters 2 and 3 can all be reformulated as finding either a longest path or a shortest path in a dag, possibly with weighted vertices or edges. In each case, the dag in question is the dependency graph of the underlying recurrence. On the other hand, “treeshaped” dynamic programming problems, like finding optimal binary search trees or maximum independent sets in trees, cannot be recast as finding an optimal path in a dag. \n6.5 Strong Connectivity \nLet’s go back to the proper definition of connectivity in directed graphs. Recall that one vertex $u$ can reach another vertex $nu$ in a directed graph $G$ if $G$ contains a directed path from $u$ to $nu$ , and that reach $( u )$ denotes the set of all vertices that $u$ can reach. Two vertices $u$ and $nu$ are strongly connected if $u$ can reach $nu$ and $nu$ can reach $u$ . A directed graph is strongly connected if and only if every pair of vertices is strongly connected. \nTedious definition-chasing implies that strong connectivity is an equivalence relation over the set of vertices of any directed graph, just like connectivity in undirected graphs. The equivalence classes of this relation are called the strongly connected components—or more simply, the strong components—of $G$ . Equivalently, a strong component of $G$ is a maximal strongly connected subgraph of $G$ . A directed graph $G$ is strongly connected if and only if $G$ has exactly one strong component; at the other extreme, $G$ is a dag if and only if every strong component of $G$ consists of a single vertex. \nThe strong component graph $s c c ( G )$ is another directed graph obtained from $G$ by contracting each strong component to a single vertex and collapsing parallel edges. (The strong component graph is sometimes also called the meta-graph or condensation of G.) It’s not hard to prove (hint, hint) that $s c c ( G )$ is always a dag. Thus, at least in principle, it is possible to topologically order the strong components of $G$ ; that is, the vertices can be ordered so that every back edge joins two edges in the same strong component.",

Thus, at least in principle, it is possible to topologically order the strong components of $G$ ; that is, the vertices can be ordered so that every back edge joins two edges in the same strong component. \n\nIt is straightforward to compute the strong component of a single vertex $nu$ in $O ( V + E )$ time. First we compute reach $( nu )$ via whatever-first search. Then we compute re $a c h ^ { - 1 } ( nu ) = { u mid nu in r e a c h ( u ) }$ by searching the reversal of $G$ . Finally, the strong component of $nu$ is the intersection $r e a c h ( nu ) cap r e a c h ^ { - 1 } ( nu )$ . In particular, we can determine whether the entire graph is strongly connected in $O ( V + E )$ time. \nSimilarly, we can compute all the strong components in a directed graph by combining the previous algorithm with our standard wrapper function. However, the resulting algorithm runs in $O ( V E )$ time; there are at most $V$ strong components, and each requires $O ( E )$ time to discover, even when the graph is a dag. Surely we can do better! After all, we only need $O ( V + E )$ time to decide whether every strong component is a single vertex. \n6.6 Strong Components in Linear Time \nIn fact, there are several algorithms to compute strong components in $O ( V + E )$ time, all of which rely on the following observation. \nLemma 6.2. Fix a depth-first traversal of any directed graph G. Each strong component $C$ of $G$ contains exactly one node that does not have a parent in $C$ . (Either this node has a parent in another strong component, or it has no parent.) \nProof: Let $C$ be an arbitrary strong component of $G$ . Consider any path from one vertex $nu in C$ to another vertex $w in C$ . Every vertex on this path can reach $w$ , and thus can reach every vertex in $C$ ; symmetrically, every node on this path can be reached by $nu$ , and thus can be reached by every vertex in $C$ . We conclude that every vertex on this path is also in $C$ .",

However, it’s actually quite easy to find a vertex in a source component—a strong component of $G$ that corresponds to a source in $s c c ( G ) .$ —using depth-first search. \nLemma 6.3. The last vertex in any postordering of G lies in a source component of $G$ . \nProof: Fix a depth-first traversal of $G$ , and let $nu$ be the last vertex in the resulting postordering. Then $mathrm { D F S } ( nu )$ must be the last direct call to DFS made by the wrapper algorithm DFSAll. Moreover, $nu$ is the root of one of the trees in the depth-first forest, so any node $x$ with $x . p o s t > nu .$ .pre is a descendant of $nu$ . Finally, $nu$ is the root of its strong component $C$ . \nFor the sake of argument, suppose there is an edge $x {  } y$ such that $x not in C$ and $y in C$ . Then $x$ can reach $y$ , and y can reach $nu$ , so $x$ can\u0001reach $nu$ . Because $nu$ is the root of $C$ , vertex $y$ is a descendant of $nu$ , and thus $nu . p r e < y . p r e$ . The edge $x {  } y$ guarantees that $y . p r e < x . p o s t$ and therefore $nu . p r e < x . p o s t$ . It follows th\u0001at $x$ is a descendant of $nu$ . But then $nu$ can reach $x$ (through tree edges), contradicting our assumption that $x not in C$ . □ \nIt is easy to check (hint, hint) that $r e nu ( s c c ( G ) ) = s c c ( r e nu ( G ) )$ for any directed graph $G$ . Thus, the last vertex in a postordering of $r e nu ( G )$ lies in a sink component of the original graph $G$ . Thus, if we traverse the graph a second time, where the wrapper function follows a reverse postordering of $r e nu ( G )$ , then each call to DFS visits exactly one strong component of $G$ .4 \nPutting everything together, we obtain the algorithm shown in Figure 6.16, which counts and labels the strong components of any directed graph in $O ( V + E )$ time. This algorithm was discovered (but never published) by Rao Kosaraju in 1978, and later independently rediscovered by Micha Sharir in 1981.5 The Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm has two phases. The first phase performs a depth-first search of $r e nu ( G )$ , pushing each vertex onto a stack when it is finished. In the second phase, we perform a whatever-first traversal of the original graph $G$ , considering vertices in the order they appear on the stack. The algorithm labels each vertex with the root of its strong component (with respect to the second depth-first traversal). \nFigure 6.17 shows the Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm running on our example graph. With only minor modifications to the algorithm, we can also compute the strong component graph $s c c ( G )$ in $O ( V + E )$ time. \nKosarajuSharir(G): $s gets$ new empty stack for all vertices $nu$ PushPostRevDFS(v, S): unmark $nu$ mark v $nu . r o o t gets mathrm { N o N E }$ for each edge $u {  } nu$ Reversed! if $u$ is unma\u0001rked Phase 1: Push in postorder in rev(G) PushPostRevDFS $( u , S )$ for all vertices $nu$ $P { cal U } S H ( nu , S )$ if $nu$ is unmarked PushPostRevDFS $( nu , S )$ LabelOneDFS(v, r): v.root r Phase 2: DFS again in stack order for each edge $nu {  } w$ while $s$ is non-empty if w.root = \u0001None $nu  P o P ( S )$ LabelOneDFS(w, r) if $nu . r o o t = mathrm { N o N E }$ LabelOneDFS(v, v) \nnTarjan’s Algorithm \nAn earlier but considerably more subtle linear-time algorithm to compute strong components was published by Bob Tarjan in 1972.6 Intuitively, Tarjan’s algorithm identifies a source component of $G$ , “deletes” it, and then “recursively” finds the remaining strong components; however, the entire computation happens during a single depth-first search. \nFix an arbitrary depth-first traversal of some directed graph $G$ . For each vertex $nu$ , let $boldsymbol { l o w } ( nu )$ denote the smallest starting time among all vertices reachable from $nu$ by a path of tree edges followed by at most one non-tree edge. Trivially, $l o w ( nu ) leq nu . p r e .$ , because $nu$ can reach itself through zero tree edges followed by zero non-tree edges. Tarjan observed that sink components can be characterized in terms of this low function. \nLemma 6.4. A vertex $nu$ is the root of a sink component of $G$ if and only if $l o w ( nu ) = nu .$ .pre and $l o w ( w ) < w$ .pre for every proper descendant w of $nu$ . \nProof: First, let $nu$ be a vertex such that $l o w ( nu ) = nu .$ pre. Then there is no edge $w {  } x$ where $w$ is a descendant of $nu$ and $x . p r e < nu$ .pre. On the other hand, $nu$ ca\u0001nnot reach any vertex y such that $y . p r e > nu . p o s t$ . It follows that $nu$ can reach only its descendants, and therefore any descendant of $nu$ can reach only descendants of $nu$ . In particular, $nu$ cannot reach its parent (if it has one), so $nu$ is the root of its strong component. \nNow suppose in addition that $l o w ( w ) < w . p r e$ for every descendant $w$ of $nu$ . Then each descendant $w$ can reach another vertex $x$ (which must be another descendant of $nu$ ) such that $x . p r e < w . p r e$ . Thus, by induction, every descendant of $nu$ can reach $nu$ . It follows that the descendants of $nu$ comprise the strong component $C$ whose root is $nu$ . Moreover, $C$ must be a sink component, because $nu$ cannot reach any vertex outside of $C$ . \nOn the other hand, suppose $nu$ is the root of a sink component $C$ . Then $nu$ can reach another vertex $w$ if and only if $w in C$ . But $nu$ can reach all of its descendants, and every vertex in $C$ is a descendant of $nu$ , so v’s descendants comprise C. If $l o w ( w ) = w . p r $ for any other node $w in C$ , then $w$ would be another root of $C$ , which is impossible. □ \nComputing $l o w ( nu )$ for every vertex $nu$ via depth-first search is straightforward; see Figure 6.18. \nLemma 6.4 implies that after running FindLow, we can identify the root of every sink component in $O ( V + E )$ time (by a global whatever-first search), and then mark and delete those sink components in $O ( V + E )$ additional time (by calling whatever-first search at each root), and then recurse. Unfortunately, the resulting algorithm might require $V$ iterations, each removing only a single vertex, naively giving us a total running time of $O ( V E )$ .",

It follows that the descendants of $nu$ comprise the strong component $C$ whose root is $nu$ . Moreover, $C$ must be a sink component, because $nu$ cannot reach any vertex outside of $C$ . \nOn the other hand, suppose $nu$ is the root of a sink component $C$ . Then $nu$ can reach another vertex $w$ if and only if $w in C$ . But $nu$ can reach all of its descendants, and every vertex in $C$ is a descendant of $nu$ , so v’s descendants comprise C. If $l o w ( w ) = w . p r $ for any other node $w in C$ , then $w$ would be another root of $C$ , which is impossible. □ \nComputing $l o w ( nu )$ for every vertex $nu$ via depth-first search is straightforward; see Figure 6.18. \nLemma 6.4 implies that after running FindLow, we can identify the root of every sink component in $O ( V + E )$ time (by a global whatever-first search), and then mark and delete those sink components in $O ( V + E )$ additional time (by calling whatever-first search at each root), and then recurse. Unfortunately, the resulting algorithm might require $V$ iterations, each removing only a single vertex, naively giving us a total running time of $O ( V E )$ . \n\nTo speed up this strategy, Tarjan’s algorithm maintains an auxiliary stack of vertices (separate from the recursion stack). Whenever we start a new vertex $nu$ , we push it onto the stack. Whenever we finish a vertex $nu$ , we compare $nu$ .low with $nu$ .pre. Then the first time we discover that $nu . l o w = nu$ .pre, we know three things: \n• Vertex $nu$ is the root of a sink component $C$ .   \n• All vertices in $C$ appear consecutively at the top of the auxiliary stack.   \n• The deepest vertex in $C$ on the auxiliary stack is $nu$ . \nAt this point, we can identify the vertices in $C$ by popping them off the auxiliary stack one by one, stopping when we pop $nu$ . \nWe could delete the vertices in $C$ and recursively compute the strong components of the remaining graph, but that would be wasteful, because we would repeat verbatim all computation done before visiting $nu$ . Instead, we label each vertex in $C$ , identifying $nu$ as the root of its strong component, and then ignore labeled vertices for the rest of the depth-first search. Formally, this modification changes the definition of $l o w ( nu )$ to the smallest starting time among all vertices in the same strong component as $nu$ that $nu$ can reach by a path of tree edges followed by at most one non-tree edge. But to prove correctness, it’s easier to observe that ignoring labeled vertices leads the algorithm to exactly the same behavior as actually deleting them. \nFinally, Tarjan’s algorithm is shown in Figure 6.19, with the necessary modifications from FindLow (Figure 6.18) indicated in bold red. The running time of the algorithm can be split into two parts. Each vertex is pushed onto $s$ once and popped off $s$ once, so the total time spent maintaining the auxiliary stack (the red stuff) is $O ( V )$ . If we ignore the auxiliary stack maintenance, the rest of the algorithm is just a standard depth-first search. We conclude that the algorithm runs in $O ( V + E )$ time. \n\nExercises \nDepth-first search, topological sort, and strong components \n0.

The police department in the city of Sham-Poobanana has made every street in the city one-way. Despite widespread complaints from confused motorists, the mayor claims that it is possible to legally drive from any intersection in Sham-Poobanana to any other intersection. \n(a) The city needs to either verify or refute the mayor’s claim. Formalize this problem in terms of graphs, and then describe and analyze an algorithm to solve it.   \n(b) After running your algorithm from part (a), the mayor reluctantly admits that she was lying misinformed. Call an intersection $x$ good if, for any intersection $y$ that one can legally reach from $x$ , it is possible to legally drive from $y$ back to $x$ . Now the mayor claims that over $9 5 %$ of the intersections in Sham-Poobanana are good. Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to verify or refute her claim. \nFor full credit, both algorithms should run in linear time. \n3. Suppose we are given a directed acyclic graph $G$ with a unique source s and a unique sink $t$ . A vertex $nu notin { s , t }$ is called an $( s , t )$ -cut vertex if every path from $s$ to $t$ passes through $nu$ , or equivalently, if deleting $nu$ makes $t$ unreachable from s. Describe and analyze an algorithm to find every $( s , t )$ -cut vertex in $G$ . \n4. A vertex $nu$ in a connected undirected graph $G$ is called a cut vertex if the subgraph $G - nu$ (obtained by removing $nu$ from $G$ ) is disconnected. \n(a) Describe a linear-time algorithm that determines, given an undirected graph $G$ and a vertex $nu$ , whether $nu$ is a cut vertex in $G$ . What is the running time to find all cut vertices by trying your algorithm for each vertex?   \n(b) Let $T$ be a depth-first spanning tree of an undirected graph $G$ . i. Prove that the root of $T$ is a cut vertex of $G$ if and only if it has more than one child in $T$ . ii. Prove that a non-root vertex $nu$ is a cut vertex of $G$ if and only if at least one descendant (in $T$ ) of each child of $nu$ (in $T$ ) is a neighbor (in $G$ ) of some proper ancestor of $nu$ (in $T$ ). [Hint: These claims no longer hold if $T$ not a depth-first spanning tree and/or $G$ is a directed graph.]   \n(c) Describe an algorithm that identifies every cut vertex in a given undirected graph in $O ( V + E )$ time. \n5. An edge e in a connected undirected graph $G$ is called a bridge (or a cut edge) if the subgraph $G - e$ (obtained by removing e from $G$ ) is disconnected. \n(a) Given $G$ and edge e describe a linear-time algorithm that determines whether $e$ is a bridge or not. What is the running time to find all bridges by trying your algorithm for each edge?   \n(b) Let $T$ be an arbitrary spanning tree of $G$ . Prove that every bridges of $G$ is also an edge in $T$ . This claim implies that $G$ has at most $V - 1$ bridges. How does this information improve your algorithm from part (a) to find all bridges?   \n(c) Now suppose we root $T$ at an arbitrary vertex $r$ . For any vertex $nu$ , let $T _ { nu }$ denote the subtree of $T$ rooted at $nu$ ; for example, $T _ { r } = T$ . Let $u nu$ be an arbitrary edge of $T$ , where $u$ is the parent of $nu$ . Prove that $u nu$ is a bridge of $G$ if and only if $u nu$ is the only edge in $G$ with exactly one endpoint in $T _ { nu }$ .   \n(d) Describe a linear-time algorithm to identify every bridge in $G$ . [Hint: Let $T$ be a depth-first spanning tree of G.] \n6. The transitive closure $G ^ { T }$ of a directed graph $G$ is a directed graph with the same vertices as $G$ , that contains any edge $u {  } nu$ if and only if there is a directed path from $u$ to $nu$ in $G$ . A transitive redu\u0001ction of $G$ is a graph with the smallest possible number of edges whose transitive closure is $G ^ { T }$ . The same graph may have several transitive reductions. \n(a) Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the transitive closure of a given directed graph. \n(b) Prove that a directed graph $G$ has a unique transitive reduction if and only if $G$ is acyclic.   \n(c) Describe an efficient algorithm to compute a transitive reduction of a given directed graph. \n7. One of the oldest algorithms for exploring arbitrary connected graphs was proposed by Gaston Tarry in 1895, as a systematic procedure for solving mazes.7 The input to Tarry’s algorithm is an undirected graph $G$ ; however, for ease of presentation, we formally split each undirected edge $u nu$ into two directed edges $u {  } nu$ and $nu {  } u$ . (In an actual implementation, this split is trivial; the algorit\u0001hm simply\u0001uses the given adjacency list for $G$ as though $G$ were directed.) \nWe informally say that Tarry’s algorithm “visits” vertex $nu$ every time it marks $nu$ , and it “traverses” edge $nu {  } w$ when it colors that edge red and recursively calls RecTarry $( w )$ . Unlike\u0001our earlier graph traversal algorithm, Tarry’s algorithm can mark same vertex multiple times. \n(a) Describe how to implement Tarry’s algorithm so that it runs in $O ( V + E )$ time.   \n(b) Prove that no directed edge in $G$ is traversed more than once.   \n(c) When the algorithm visits a vertex $nu$ for the $k$ th time, exactly how many edges into $nu$ are red, and exactly how many edges out of $nu$ are red? [Hint: Consider the starting vertex s separately from the other vertices.]   \n(d) Prove each vertex $nu$ is visited at most $deg ( nu )$ times, except the starting vertex s, which is visited at most $deg ( s ) + 1$ times. This claim immediately implies that Tarry $( G )$ terminates. \n(e) Prove that the last vertex visited by Tarry $( G )$ is the starting vertex s. \n(f) For every vertex $nu$ that Tarry $( G )$ visits, prove that all edges into $nu$ and out of $nu$ are red when Tarry $( G )$ halts. [Hint: Consider the vertices in the order that they are marked for the first time, starting with $s$ , and prove the claim by induction.]   \n(g) Prove that Tarry $( G )$ visits every vertex of $G$ . This claim and the previous claim imply that Tarry $( G )$ traverses every edge of $G$ exactly once. \n8. Consider the following variant of Tarry’s graph-traversal algorithm; this variant traverses green edges without recoloring them red and assigns two numerical labels to every vertex: \nProve or disprove the following claim: When Tarry2 $( G )$ halts, the green edges define a spanning tree and the labels $nu$ .pre and $nu$ .post define a preorder and postorder labeling that are all consistent with a single depth-first search of $G$ . In other words, prove or disprove that Tarry2 produces the same output as depth-first search, even though it visits the edges in a completely different order. \n9. You have a collection of $n$ lock-boxes and $m$ gold keys. Each key unlocks at most one box. However, each box might be unlocked by one key, by multiple keys, or by no keys at all. There are only two ways to open each box once it is locked: Unlock it properly (which requires having one matching key in your hand), or smash it to bits with a hammer. \nYour baby brother, who loves playing with shiny objects, has somehow managed to lock all your keys inside the boxes! Luckily, your home security system recorded everything, so you know exactly which keys (if any) are inside each box. You need to get all the keys back out of the boxes, because they are made of gold. Clearly you have to smash at least one box. \n(a) Your baby brother has found the hammer and is eagerly eyeing one of the boxes. Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine if it is \npossible to retrieve all the keys without smashing any box except the one your brother has chosen. (b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum number of boxes that must be smashed to retrieve all the keys. \n10. Suppose you are teaching an algorithms course. In your second midterm, you give your students a drawing of a graph and ask then to indicate a breadth-first search tree and a depth-first search tree rooted at a particular vertex. Unfortunately, once you start grading the exam, you realize that the graph you gave the students has several such spanning trees—far too many to list. Instead, you need a way to tell whether each student’s submission is correct! \nIn each of the following problems, suppose you are given a connected graph $G$ , a start vertex s, and a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ . \n(a) Suppose $G$ is undirected. Describe and analyze an algorithm to decide whether $T$ is a depth-first spanning tree rooted at $s$ .   \n(b) Suppose $G$ is undirected. Describe and analyze an algorithm to decide whether $T$ is a breadth-first spanning tree rooted at s. [Hint: It’s not enough for $T$ to be an unweighted shortest-path tree. Yes, this is the right chapter for this problem!]   \n(c) Suppose $G$ is directed. Describe and analyze an algorithm to decide whether $T$ is a breadth-first spanning tree rooted at s. [Hint: Solve part $( b )$ first.]   \n(d) Suppose $G$ is directed. Describe and analyze an algorithm to decide whether $T$ is a depth-first spanning tree rooted at $s$ . \n11. Several modern programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, Perl, and Ruby, include a feature called parallel assignment, which allows multiple assignment operations to be encoded in a single line of code. For example, the Python code $mathsf { x } , mathsf { y } = mathsf { 0 } , mathsf { 1 }$ simultaneously sets $x$ to 0 and y to 1. The values of the right-hand side of the assignment are all determined by the old values of the variables. Thus, the Python code a, ${ mathsf b } = { mathsf b }$ ,a swaps the values of a and b, and the following Python code computes the nth Fibonacci number: \ndef fib(n): prev, curr $= ~ 1$ , 0 while $n > 0$ : prev, curr, ${ mathfrak { n } } =$ curr, prev+curr, n-1 return curr \nSuppose the interpreter you are writing needs to convert every parallel assignment into an equivalent sequence of individual assignments. For example, the parallel assignment a, ${ bf b } = boldsymbol { 0 } , 1$ can be serialized in either order— either $a = 0$ ; $b = 1$ or $a = 0$ ; $b = 1$ —but the parallel assignment $mathsf { x } , mathsf { y } = mathsf { x } + 1$ , $x + y$ can only be serialized as $y = x + y$ ; $x = x + 1$ . Serialization may require one or more additional temporary variables; for example, serializing a, $b = 6$ ,a requires one temporary variable, and serializing $x , y = x { + } y$ , $x - y$ requires two temporary variables. \n\n(a) Describe an algorithm to determine whether a given parallel assignment can be serialized without additional temporary variables.   \n(b) Describe an algorithm to determine whether a given parallel assignment can be serialized with exactly one additional temporary variable. \nAssume that the given parallel assignment involves only simple integer variables (no indirection via pointers or arrays); no variable appears on the left side more than once; and expressions on the right side have no side effects. Don’t worry about the details of parsing the assignment statement; just assume (but describe!) an appropriate graph representation. \nDynamic Programming \n12. Suppose we are given a directed acyclic graph $G$ whose nodes represent jobs and whose edges represent precedence constraints; that is. each edge $u {  } nu$ indicates the job $u$ must be completed before job $nu$ begins. Each node $nu$ al\u0001so has a weight $T ( nu )$ indicating the time required to execute job $nu$ . \n(a) Describe an algorithm to determine the shortest interval of time in which all jobs in $G$ can be executed.   \n(b) Suppose the first job starts at time 0. Describe an algorithm to determine, for each vertex $nu$ , the earliest time when job $nu$ can begin.   \n(c) Now describe an algorithm to determine, for each vertex $nu$ , the latest time when job $nu$ can begin without violating the precedence constraints or increasing the overall completion time (computed in part (a)), assuming that every job except $nu$ starts at its earliest start time (computed in part (b)). \n13. Let $G$ be a directed acyclic graph with a unique source s and a unique sink $t$ . \n(a) A Hamiltonian path in $G$ is a directed path in $G$ that contains every vertex in $G$ . Describe an algorithm to determine whether $G$ has a Hamiltonian path.   \n(b) Suppose the vertices of $G$ have weights. Describe an efficient algorithm to find the path from $s$ to $t$ with maximum total weight.   \n(c) Suppose we are also given an integer $ell$ . Describe an efficient algorithm to find the maximum-weight path from $s$ to $t$ that contains at most $ell$ edges. (Assume there is at least one such path.)   \n(d) Suppose some of the vertices of $G$ are marked as important, and we are also given an integer $k$ . Describe an efficient algorithm to find the maximum-weight path from s to $t$ that visits at least $k$ important vertices. (Assume there is at least one such path.)   \n(e) Describe an algorithm to compute the number of paths from s to $t$ in $G$ . (Assume that you can add arbitrarily large integers in $O ( 1 )$ time.) \n\n14. Let $G$ be a directed acyclic graph whose vertices have labels from some fixed alphabet, and let $A [ 1 ldots ell ]$ be a string over the same alphabet. Any directed path in $G$ has a label, which is a string obtained by concatenating the labels of its vertices. \n(a) Describe an algorithm that either finds a path in $G$ whose label is $A$ or correctly reports that there is no such path.   \n(b) Describe an algorithm to find the number of paths in $G$ whose label is $A$ . (Assume that you can add arbitrarily large integers in $O ( 1 )$ time.)   \n(c) Describe an algorithm to find the longest path in $G$ whose label is a subsequence of A.   \n(d) Describe an algorithm to find the shortest path in $G$ whose label is a supersequence of A.   \n(e) Describe an algorithm to find a path in $G$ whose label has minimum edit distance from A. \n15. A polygonal path is a sequence of line segments joined end-to-end; the endpoints of these line segments are called the vertices of the path. The length of a polygonal path is the sum of the lengths of its segments. A polygonal path with vertices $( x _ { 1 } , y _ { 1 } ) , ( x _ { 2 } , y _ { 2 } ) , ldots , ( x _ { k } , y _ { k } )$ is monotonically increasing if $x _ { i } < x _ { i + 1 }$ and $y _ { i } < y _ { i + 1 }$ for every index $i$ —informally, each vertex of the path is above and to the right of its predecessor. \nSuppose you are given a set $s$ of $n$ points in the plane, represented as two arrays $X [ 1 ldots n ]$ and $Y [ 1 ldots n ]$ . Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the length of the longest monotonically increasing path with vertices in $s$ . Assume you have a subroutine $mathrm { L E N G T H } ( x , y , x ^ { prime } , y ^ { prime } )$ that returns the length of the segment from $( x , y )$ to $( x ^ { prime } , y ^ { prime } )$ . \n16. For any two nodes $u$ and $w$ in a directed acyclic graph $G$ , the interval $G [ u , w ]$ is the union of all directed paths in $G$ from $u$ to $nu$ . Equivalently, $G [ u , w ]$ consists of all vertices $nu$ such that $nu in r e a c h ( u )$ and $w in r e a c h ( x )$ , together with all the edges in $G$ connecting those vertices. \nSuppose we are given a directed acyclic graph $G$ , in which every vertex has a numerical weight, which may be positive, negative, or zero. \n(a) Describe an efficient algorithm to find the maximum-weight interval in $G$ , where the weight of each interval is the sum of the weights of its vertices.   \n(b) Describe an efficient algorithm to find the largest vertex weight in every interval in $G$ . Your algorithm should compute a two-dimensional array $M a x W t [ 1 ldots V , 1 ldots V ]$ where each entry $M a x W t [ u , w ]$ is the maximum weight among all vertices in the interval $G [ u , w ]$ . In particular, if $G [ u , w ]$ is empty, then $M a x W t [ u , w ]$ should be $- infty$ . \n17. Let $G$ be a directed acyclic graph whose vertices have labels from some fixed alphabet. Any directed path in $G$ has a label, which is a string obtained by concatenating the labels of its vertices. Recall that a palindrome is a string that is equal to its reversal. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the length of the longest palindrome that is the label of a path in $G$ . For example, given the graph in Figure 6.23, your algorithm should return the integer 6, which is the length of the palindrome HANNAH. \n(b) Describe an algorithm to find the longest palindrome that is a subsequence of the label of a path in $G$ .   \n(c) Suppose $G$ has a single source s and a single sink t. Describe an algorithm to find the shortest palindrome that is a supersequence of the label of a path in $G$ from $s$ to $t$ . \n18. Suppose you are given two directed acyclic graphs $G$ and $H$ in which every node has a label from some finite alphabet; different nodes may have the same label. The label of a path in either dag is the string obtained by concatenating the labels of its vertices. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the length of the longest string that is both the label of a path in $G$ and the label of a path in $H$ .   \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the length of the longest string that is both a subsequence of the label of a path in $G$ and a subsequence of the label of a path in $H$ .   \n(c) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the length of the shortest string that is both a supersequence of the label of a path in $G$ and a supersequence of the label of a path in $H$ . [Hint: This is easier than it looks.] \n19. Let $G$ be an arbitrary (not necessarily acyclic) directed graph in which every vertex $nu$ has an integer weight $w ( nu )$ . \n(a) Describe an algorithm to find the longest directed path in $G$ whose vertex weights define an increasing sequence.   \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine the maximum-weight vertex reachable from each vertex in $G$ . That is, for each vertex $nu$ , your algorithm needs to compute maxreach $( nu ) : = operatorname* { m a x } { w ( x ) mid x in r e a c h ( nu ) }$ . \n20. (a) Suppose you are given a directed acyclic graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and an integer $k leq n$ . Describe an efficient algorithm to find a set of at most $k$ vertex-disjoint paths that visit every vertex in $G$ . (b) Now suppose the edges of the input dag $G$ have weights, which may be positive, negative, or zero. Describe an efficient algorithm to find a set of at most $k$ vertex-disjoint paths with minimum total weight that visit every vertex in $G$ . \nYour algorithms should run in $O ( n ^ { k + c } )$ time for some small constant c. A single vertex is a path with weight zero. (We will see a more efficient algorithm for part (a) in Chapter 11.) \n21. Kris is a professional rock climber who is competing in the U.S. climbing nationals. The competition requires Kris to use as many holds on the climbing wall as possible, using only transitions that have been explicitly allowed by the route-setter. \nThe climbing wall has $n$ holds. Kris is given a list of $m$ pairs $( x , y )$ of holds, each indicating that moving directly from hold $x$ to hold $y$ is allowed; however, moving directly from $y$ to $x$ is not allowed unless the list also includes the pair $( y , x )$ . Kris needs to figure out a sequence of allowed transitions that uses as many holds as possible, since each new hold increases his score by one point. The rules allow Kris to choose the first and last hold in his climbing route. The rules also allow him to use each hold as many times as he likes; however, only the first use of each hold increases Kris’s score. \n(a) Define the natural graph representing the input. Describe and analyze an algorithm to solve Kris’s climbing problem if you are guaranteed that the input graph is a dag.   \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to solve Kris’s climbing problem with no restrictions on the input graph. \nBoth of your algorithms should output the maximum possible score that Kris can earn. \n22. There are $n$ galaxies connected by $m$ intergalactic teleport-ways. Each teleport-way joins two galaxies and can be traversed in both directions. However, the company that runs the teleport-ways has established an extremely lucrative cost structure: Anyone can teleport further from their home galaxy at no cost whatsoever, but teleporting toward their home galaxy is prohibitively expensive. \nJudy has decided to take a sabbatical tour of the universe by visiting as many galaxies as possible, starting at her home galaxy. To save on travel expenses, she wants to teleport away from her home galaxy at every step, except for the very last teleport home. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the maximum number of galaxies that Judy can visit. Your input consists of an undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges describing the teleport-way network, an integer $1 leq s leq n$ identifying Judy’s home galaxy, and an array $D [ 1 ldots n ]$ containing the distances of each galaxy from s.   \nn(b) Just before embarking on her universal tour, Judy wins the space lottery, giving her just enough money to afford two teleports toward her home galaxy. Describe a new algorithm to compute the maximum number of distinct galaxies Judy can visit. She can visit the same galaxy more than once, but crucially, only the first visit counts toward her total. \n23. The Doctor and River Song decide to play a game on a directed acyclic graph $G$ , which has one source $s$ and one sink $t$ .8 \nEach player has a token on one of the vertices of $G$ . At the start of the game, The Doctor’s token is on the source vertex s, and River’s token is on the sink vertex t. The players alternate turns, with The Doctor moving first. On each of his turns, the Doctor moves his token forward along a directed edge; on each of her turns, River moves her token backward along a directed edge. \nIf the two tokens ever meet on the same vertex, River wins the game. (“Hello, Sweetie!”) If the Doctor’s token reaches t or River’s token reaches s before the two tokens meet, then the Doctor wins the game. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to determine who wins this game, assuming both players play perfectly. That is, if the Doctor can win no matter how River moves, then your algorithm should output “Doctor”, and if River can win no matter how the Doctor moves, your algorithm should output “River”. (Why are these the only two possibilities?) The input to your algorithm is the graph $G$ . \n$a v _ { 2 4 }$ . Let $x = x _ { 1 } x _ { 2 } ldots x _ { n }$ be a given $n$ -character string over some finite alphabet $Sigma$ , and let $A$ be a deterministic finite-state machine with m states over the same alphabet. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the length of the longest subsequence of $x$ that is accepted by $A .$ . For example, if A accepts the language $( mathsf { A R } ) ^ { * }$ and $x =$ ABRACADABRA, your algorithm should output the number 4, which is the length of the subsequence ARAR.   \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the length of the shortest supersequence of $x$ that is accepted by $A$ . For example, if $A$ accepts the language (ABCDR)∗ and $x =$ ABRACADABRA, your algorithm should output the number 25, which is the length of the supersequence ABCDRABCDRABCDRABCDRABCDR. \nAnalyze your algorithms in terms of the length $n$ of the input string, the number m of states in the finite-state machine, and the size of the alphabet $Sigma$ . \n25. Not every dynamic programming algorithm can be modeled as finding an optimal path through a directed acyclic graph, but every dynamic programming algorithm does process some underlying dependency graph in postorder. \n(a) Suppose we are given a directed acyclic graph $G$ where every node stores a numerical search key.

This chapter describes several algorithms to find the minimum spanning tree of $G$ , that is, the spanning tree $T$ that minimizes the function \nSee Figure 7.1 for an example. \n7.1 Distinct Edge Weights \nAn annoying subtlety in the problem statement is that weighted graphs can have more than one spanning tree with the same minimum weight; in particular, if every edge in $G$ has weight 1, then every spanning tree of $G$ is a minimum spanning tree, with weight $V - 1$ . This ambiguity complicates the development of our algorithms; everything would be much simpler if we could simply assume that minimum spanning trees are unique. \n\nFortunately, there is an easy condition that implies the uniqueness we want. \nLemma 7.1. If all edge weights in a connected graph $G$ are distinct, then $G$ has a unique minimum spanning tree. \nProof: Let $G$ be an arbitrary connected graph with two minimum spanning trees $T$ and $T ^ { prime }$ ; we need to prove that some pair of edges in $G$ have the same weight. The proof is essentially a greedy exchange argument. \nEach of our spanning trees must contain an edge that the other tree omits. Let $e$ be a minimum-weight edge in $T setminus T ^ { prime }$ , and let $e ^ { prime }$ be a minimum-weight edge in $T ^ { prime } backslash T$ (breaking ties arbitrarily). Without loss of generality, suppose $w ( e ) leq w ( e ^ { prime } )$ . \nThe subgraph $T ^ { prime } cup { e }$ contains exactly one cycle $C$ , which passes through the edge e. Let $e ^ { prime prime }$ be any edge of this cycle that is not in $T$ . At least one such edge must exist, because $T$ is a tree. (We may or may not have $e ^ { prime prime } = e ^ { prime }$ .) Because $e in T$ , we immediately have $e ^ { prime prime } ne e$ and therefore $e ^ { prime prime } in T ^ { prime } setminus T$ . It follows that $w ( e ^ { prime prime } ) geq w ( e ^ { prime } ) geq w ( e )$ . \nNow consider the spanning tree $T ^ { prime prime } { = } T ^ { prime } { + } e - e ^ { prime prime }$ . (This new tree $T ^ { prime prime }$ might be equal to $T$ .) We immediately have $w ( T ^ { prime prime } ) = w ( T ^ { prime } ) + w ( e ) - w ( e ^ { prime prime } ) leq w ( T ^ { prime } )$ . But $T ^ { prime }$ is a minimum spanning tree, so we must have $w ( T ^ { prime prime } ) = w ( T ^ { prime } )$ ; in other words, $T ^ { prime prime }$ is also a minimum spanning tree. We conclude that $w ( e ) = w ( e ^ { prime prime } )$ , which completes the proof. □ \nIf we already have an algorithm that assumes distinct edge weights, we can still run it on graphs where some edges have equal weights, as long as we have a consistent method for breaking ties. One such method uses the following algorithm in place of simple weight comparisons. ShorterEdge takes as input four integers $i , j , k , l$ , representing four (not necessarily distinct) vertices, and decides which of the two edges $( i , j )$ and $( k , l )$ has “smaller” weight. (Because the input graph undirected, the pairs $( i , j )$ and $( j , i )$ represent the same edge.) \n\nIn light of Lemma 7.1 and this tie-breaking rule, we will safely assume for the rest of this chapter that edge weights are always distinct, and therefore minimum spanning trees are always unique. In particular, we can freely discuss the minimum spanning tree with no confusion. \n7.2 The Only Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm \nThere are many algorithms to compute minimum spanning trees, but almost all of them are instances of the following generic strategy. The situation is similar to graph traversal, where several different algorithms are all variants of the generic traversal algorithm whatever-first search. \nThe generic minimum spanning tree algorithm maintains an acyclic subgraph $F$ of the input graph $G$ , which we will call the intermediate spanning forest. At all times, $F$ satisfies the following invariant: \n$F$ is a subgraph of the minimum spanning tree of G. \nInitially, $F$ consists of $V$ one-vertex trees. The generic algorithm connects trees in $F$ by adding certain edges between them. When the algorithm halts, $F$ consists of a single spanning tree; our invariant implies that this must be the minimum spanning tree of $G$ . Obviously, we have to be careful about which edges we add to the evolving forest, because not every edge is in the minimum spanning tree. \nAt any stage of its evolution, the intermediate spanning forest $F$ induces two special types of edges in the rest of the graph. \n• An edge is useless if it is not an edge of $F$ , but both its endpoints are in the same component of $F$ .   \n• An edge is safe if it is the minimum-weight edge with exactly one endpoint in some component of $F$ .",

Some edges of $G setminus F$ are neither safe nor useless; we call these edges undecided. \nAll minimum spanning tree algorithms are based on two simple observations. The first observation was proved by Robert Prim in 1957 (although it is implicit in several earlier algorithms), and the second is immediate. \nLemma 7.2 (Prim). The minimum spanning tree of $G$ contains every safe edge. \nProof: In fact we prove the following stronger statement: For any subset $s$ of the vertices of $G$ , the minimum spanning tree of $G$ contains the minimum-weight edge with exactly one endpoint in S. Like the previous lemma, we prove this claim using a greedy exchange argument. \nLet $s$ be an arbitrary subset of vertices of $G$ , and let $e$ be the lightest edge with exactly one endpoint in $s$ . (Our assumption that all edge weights are distinct implies that e is unique.) Let $T$ be an arbitrary spanning tree that does not contain $e$ ; we need to prove that $T$ is not the minimum spanning tree of $G$ . \nBecause $T$ is connected, it contains a path from one endpoint of $e$ to the other. Because this path starts at a vertex of $s$ and ends at a vertex not in $s$ , it must contain at least one edge with exactly one endpoint in $s$ ; let $e ^ { prime }$ be any such edge. Because $T$ is acyclic, removing $e ^ { prime }$ from $T$ yields a spanning forest with exactly two components, one containing each endpoint of $e$ . Thus, adding $e$ to this forest gives us a new spanning tree $T ^ { prime } = T - e ^ { prime } + e$ . The definition of $e$ implies $w ( e ^ { prime } ) > w ( e )$ , which implies that $T ^ { prime }$ has smaller total weight than $T$ . Thus, $T$ is not the minimum spanning tree of $G$ , which completes the proof. □ \nLemma 7.3. The minimum spanning tree contains no useless edge. \nProof: Adding any useless edge to $F$ would introduce a cycle. \nOur generic minimum spanning tree algorithm repeatedly adds safe edges to the evolving forest $F$ . If $F$ is not yet connected, there must be at least one safe edge, because the input graph $G$ is connected. Thus, no matter which safe edges we add in each iteration, our generic algorithm eventually connects $F$ . By induction, Lemma 7.2 implies that the resulting tree is in fact the minimum spanning tree. Whenever we add new edges to $F$ , some undecided edges may become safe, and other undecided edges may become useless. (Once an edge becomes useless, it stays useless forever.) To fully specify a particular algorithm, we must describe which safe edge(s) to add in each iteration, and how to find those edges. \n\n7.3 Borůvka’s Algorithm \nThe oldest and arguably simplest minimum spanning tree algorithm was discovered by the Czech mathematician Otakar Borůvka in 1926, about a year after Jindřich Saxel asked him how to construct an electrical network connecting several cities using the least amount of wire.2 The algorithm was rediscovered by Gustav Choquet in 1938, rediscovered again by a team of Polish mathematicians led by Józef Łukaszewicz in 1951, and rediscovered again by George Sollin in 1961. Although Sollin never published his rediscovery, it was carefully described and credited in one of the first textbooks on graph algorithms; as a result, this algorithm is sometimes called “Sollin’s algorithm”. \nThe Borůvka / Choquet / Florek-Łukaziewicz-Perkal-Steinhaus-Zubrzycki / Prim / Sollin / Brosh3 algorithm can be summarized in one line: \nHere is Borůvka’s algorithm in more detail. The algorithm calls the CountAndLabel algorithm from Chapter 5 (on page 204) to count the components of $F$ and label each vertex $nu$ with an integer comp $( nu )$ indicating its component.",

        "content": "It remains only to describe how to identify and add all the safe edges to $F$ . Suppose $F$ has more than one component, since otherwise we’re already done. The following subroutine computes an array $s a f e [ 1 ldots V ]$ of safe edges, where safe[i] is the minimum-weight edge with one endpoint in the ith component of $F$ , by a brute force examination of every edge in $G$ . For each edge $u nu$ , if $u$ and $nu$ are in the same component, then $u nu$ is either useless or already an edge in $F$ . Otherwise, we compare the weight of $u nu$ to the weights of safe $left[ c o m p ( u ) right]$ and sa $f e [ c o m p ( nu ) ]$ and update the array entries if necessary. Once we have identified all the safe edges, we add each edge safe[i] to $F$ . \nEach call to CountAndLabel runs in $O ( V )$ time, because the forest $F$ has at most $V - 1$ edges. AddAllSafeEdges runs in $O ( V + E )$ time, because we spend constant time on each vertex, each edge of $G$ , and each component of $F$ . Because the input graph is connected, we have $V leq E + 1$ . It follows that each iteration of the while loop of Borůvka takes $O ( E )$ time. \nEach iteration reduces the number of components of $F$ by at least a factor of two—in the worst case, the components of $F$ coalesce in pairs. Because $F$ initially has $V$ components, the while loop iterates at most $O ( log V )$ times. We conclude that the overall running time of Borůvka’s algorithm is $ { boldsymbol { O } } ( E log V )$ . \nThis is the MST Algorithm You Want \nDespite its relatively obscure origin, early Western algorithms researchers were aware of Borůvka’s algorithm, but dismissed it as being “too complicated”. \nAs a result, despite its simplicity and efficiency, most algorithms and data structures textbooks unfortunately do not even mention Borůvka’s algorithm. This omission is a serious mistake; Borůvka’s algorithm has several distinct advantages over other classical MST algorithms. \n• Borůvka’s algorithm often runs faster than its $O ( E log V )$ worst-case running time. The number of components in $F$ can drop by significantly more than a factor of 2 in a single iteration, reducing the number of iterations below the worst-case $lceil log _ { 2 } V rceil$ .   \n• A slight reformulation of Borůvka’s algorithm (actually closer to Borůvka’s original presentation) actually runs in $O ( E )$ time for a broad class of interesting graphs, including graphs that can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings. In contrast, the time analysis for the other two algorithms applies to all graphs.   \n• Borůvka’s algorithm allows for significant parallelism; in each iteration, each component of $F$ can be handled in a separate independent thread. This implicit parallelism allows for even faster performance on multicore or distributed systems. In contrast, the other two classical MST algorithms are intrinsically serial.   \n• Several more recent minimum-spanning-tree algorithms are faster even in the worst case than the classical algorithms described here. All of these faster algorithms are generalizations of Borůvka’s algorithm. \nIn short, if you ever need to implement a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm, use Borůvka. On the other hand, if you want to prove things about minimum spanning trees effectively, you really need to know the next two algorithms as well. \n7.4 Jarník’s (“Prim’s”) Algorithm \nThe next oldest minimum spanning tree algorithm was first described by the Czech mathematician Vojtěch Jarník in a 1929 letter to Borůvka; Jarník published his discovery the following year. The algorithm was independently rediscovered by Joseph Kruskal in 1956, (arguably) by Robert Prim in 1957, by Harry Loberman and Arnold Weinberger in 1957, and finally by Edsger Dijkstra in 1958. Prim, Lobermand and Weinberger, and Dijkstra all (eventually) knew of and even cited Kruskal’s paper, but since Kruskal also described two other minimumspanning-tree algorithms in the same paper, this algorithm is usually called “Prim’s algorithm”, or sometimes “the Prim/Dijkstra algorithm”, even though by 1958 Dijkstra already had another algorithm (inappropriately) named after him. \nIn Jarník’s algorithm, the intermediate forest $F$ has only one nontrivial component $T$ ; all the other components are isolated vertices. Initially, $T$ consists of a single arbitrary vertex of the graph. The algorithm repeats the following step until $T$ spans the whole graph:",

        "content": "Jarník: Repeatedly add T’s safe edge to T. \nTo implement Jarník’s algorithm, we keep all the edges adjacent to $T$ in a priority queue. When we pull the minimum-weight edge out of the priority queue, we first check whether both of its endpoints are in $T$ . If not, we add the edge to $T$ and then add the new neighboring edges to the priority queue. In other words, Jarník’s algorithm is a variant of “best-first search”, as described at the end of Chapter 5! If we implement the underlying priority queue using a standard binary heap, Jarník’s algorithm runs in $O ( E log E ) = O ( E log V )$ time. \nnImproving Jarník’s Algorithm \nWe can improve Jarník’s algorithm using a more complex priority queue data structure called a Fibonacci heap, first described by Michael Fredman and Robert Tarjan in 1984. Just like binary heaps, Fibonacci heaps support the standard priority queue operations Insert, ExtractMin, and DecreaseKey. However, unlike standard binary heaps, which require $O ( log n )$ time for every operation, Fibonacci heaps support Insert and DecreaseKey in constant amortized time. The amortized cost of ExtractMin is still $O ( log n )$ .4 \nTo apply this faster data structure, we keep the vertices of $G$ in the priority queue instead of edges, where the priority of each vertex $nu$ is either the minimumweight edge between $nu$ and the evolving tree $T$ , or $infty$ if there is no such edge. We can Insert all the vertices into the priority queue at the beginning of the algorithm; then, whenever we add a new edge to $T$ , we may need to decrease the priorities of some neighboring vertices. \nTo make the description easier, we break the algorithm into two parts. JarníkInit initializes the priority queue; JarníkLoop is the main algorithm. The input consists of the vertices and edges of the graph, along with the start vertex s. For each vertex $nu$ , we maintain both its priority priority $( nu )$ and the incident edge edge $( nu )$ such that $w ( e d g e ( nu ) ) = p r i o r i t y ( nu )$ . \nThe operations Insert and ExtractMin are each called $O ( V )$ times once for each vertex except $s$ , and DecreaseKey is called $O ( E )$ times, at most twice for each edge. Thus, if we use a Fibonacci heap, the improved algorithm runs in $O ( E + V log V )$ time, which is faster than Borůvka’s algorithm unless $E = O ( V )$ . \nIn practice, however, this improvement is rarely faster than the naive implementation using a binary heap, unless the graph is extremely large and dense. The Fibonacci heap algorithms are quite complex, and the hidden constants in both the running time and space are significant—not outrageous, but certainly bigger than the hidden constant 1 in the $O ( log n )$ time bound for binary heap operations. \n7.5 Kruskal’s Algorithm \nThe last minimum spanning tree algorithm we’ll consider was first described by Joseph Kruskal in 1956, in the same paper where he rediscovered Jarnik’s algorithm. Kruskal was motivated by “a typewritten translation (of obscure origin)” of Borůvka’s original paper that had been “floating around” the Princeton math department. Kruskal found Borůvka’s algorithm “unnecessarily elaborate”.5 The same algorithm was rediscovered in 1957 by Harry Loberman and Arnold Weinberger, but somehow avoided being renamed after them.",

Kruskal was motivated by “a typewritten translation (of obscure origin)” of Borůvka’s original paper that had been “floating around” the Princeton math department. Kruskal found Borůvka’s algorithm “unnecessarily elaborate”.5 The same algorithm was rediscovered in 1957 by Harry Loberman and Arnold Weinberger, but somehow avoided being renamed after them. \n\nLike our earlier minimum-spanning tree algorithms, Kruskal’s algorithm has a memorable one-line description: \nThe simplest method to scan the edges in increasing weight order is to sort the edges by weight, in $O ( E log E )$ time, and then use a simple for-loop over the sorted edge list. As we will see shortly, this preliminary sorting dominates the running time of the algorithm. \nBecause we examine the edges in order from lightest to heaviest, any edge we examine is safe if and only if its endpoints are in different components of the forest $F$ . Suppose we encounter an edge e that joins two components $A$ and $B$ but is not safe. Then there must be a lighter edge $e ^ { prime }$ with exactly one endpoint in A. But this is impossible, because (inductively) every previously examined edge has both endpoints in the same component of $F$ . \nJust as in Borůvka’s algorithm, each vertex of $F$ needs to \"know\" which component of $F$ contains it. Unlike Borůvka’s algorithm, however, we do not recompute all component labels from scratch every time we add an edge. Instead, when two components are joined by an edge, the smaller component inherits the label of the larger component; that is, we traverse the smaller component (via whatever-first search). This traversal requires $O ( 1 )$ time for each vertex in the smaller component. Each time the component label of a vertex changes, the component of $F$ containing that vertex grows by at least a factor of 2; thus, each vertex label changes at most $O ( log V )$ times. It follows that the total time spent updating vertex labels is only $O ( V log V )$ . \n\nMore generally, Kruskal’s algorithm maintains a partition of the vertices of $G$ into disjoint subsets (in our case, the components of $F$ ), using a data structure that supports the following operations: \n• MakeSet $( nu )$ — Create a set containing only the vertex $nu$ . • $mathrm { F I N D } ( nu )$ — Return an identifier unique to the set containing $nu$ . • $mathrm { U N I O N } ( u , nu )$ — Replace the sets containing $u$ and $nu$ with their union. (This operation decreases the number of sets.) \nHere’s a complete description of Kruskal’s algorithm in terms of these operations: \nAfter the initial sort, the algorithm performs exactly $V$ MakeSet operations (one for each vertex), $2 E$ Find operations (two for each edge), and $V - 1$ Union operations (one for each edge in the minimum spanning tree). We just described a disjoint-set data structure for which MakeSet and Find require $O ( 1 )$ time, and Union runs in $O ( log V )$ amortized time. Using this implementation, the total time spent maintaining the set partition is $O ( E + V log V )$ .6 \nBut recall that we already need $O ( E log E ) = O ( E log V )$ time just to sort the edges. Because this is larger than the time spent maintaining the Union-Find data structure, the overall running time of Kruskal’s algorithm is $O ( E log V )$ , exactly the same as Borůvka’s algorithm, or Jarník’s algorithm with a normal (non-Fibonacci) heap. \n\nExercises \n1.

In fact, a weaker condition on the edge weights implies MST uniqueness. \n(a) Describe an edge-weighted graph that has a unique minimum spanning tree, even though two edges have equal weights.   \n(b) Prove that an edge-weighted graph $G$ has a unique minimum spanning tree if and only if the following conditions hold: • For any partition of the vertices of $G$ into two subsets, the minimumweight edge with one endpoint in each subset is unique. • The maximum-weight edge in any cycle of $G$ is unique. \n(c) Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether or not a graph has a unique minimum spanning tree. \n3. Most classical minimum-spanning-tree algorithms use the notions of “safe” and “useless” edges described in the text, but there is an alternate formulation. Let $G$ be a weighted undirected graph, where the edge weights are distinct. We say that an edge e is dangerous if it is the longest edge in some cycle in $G$ , and useful if it does not lie in any cycle in $G$ . \n(a) Prove that the minimum spanning tree of $G$ contains every useful edge. (b) Prove that the minimum spanning tree of $G$ does not contain any dangerous edge. (c) Describe and analyze an efficient implementation of the following algorithm, first described by Joseph Kruskal in the same 1956 paper where he proposed “Kruskal’s algorithm”. Examine the edges of $G$ in decreasing order; if an edge is dangerous, remove it from $G$ . [Hint: It won’t be as fast as Kruskal’s usual algorithm.] 4. (a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the maximum-weight spanning tree of a given edge-weighted graph. \n(b) A feedback edge set of an undirected graph $G$ is a subset $F$ of the edges such that every cycle in $G$ contains at least one edge in $F$ . In other words, removing every edge in $F$ makes the graph $G$ acyclic. Describe and analyze a fast algorithm to compute the minimum-weight feedback edge set of a given edge-weighted graph. \n5. Suppose we are given both an undirected graph $G$ with weighted edges and a minimum spanning tree $T$ of $G$ . \n(a) Describe an algorithm to update the minimum spanning tree when the weight of a single edge $e$ is decreased.   \n(b) Describe an algorithm to update the minimum spanning tree when the weight of a single edge $e$ is increased. \nIn both cases, the input to your algorithm is the edge e and its new weight; your algorithms should modify $T$ so that it is still a minimum spanning tree. [Hint: Consider the cases $e in T$ and $e not in T$ separately.] \n6. (a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the second smallest spanning tree of a given graph $G$ , that is, the spanning tree of $G$ with smallest total weight except for the minimum spanning tree. n(b) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute, given a weighted undirected graph $G$ and an integer $k$ , the $k$ spanning trees of $G$ with smallest weight. \n7. A graph $G = ( V , E )$ is dense if $E = Theta ( V ^ { 2 } )$ . Describe a modification of Jarník’s minimum-spanning tree algorithm that runs in $O ( V ^ { 2 } )$ time (independent of $E$ ) when the input graph is dense, using only elementary data structures—in particular, without using Fibonacci heaps. This variant of Jarník’s algorithm was first described by Edsger Dijkstra in 1958. \n8. Minimum-spanning tree algorithms are often formulated using an operation called edge contraction. To contract the edge $u nu$ , we insert a new node, redirect any edge incident to $u$ or $nu$ (except $u nu$ ) to this new node, and then delete $u$ and $nu$ . After contraction, there may be multiple parallel edges between the new node and other nodes in the graph; we remove all but the lightest edge between any two nodes. \nThe three classical minimum-spanning tree algorithms described in this chapter can all be expressed cleanly in terms of contraction as follows. All three algorithms start by making a clean copy $G ^ { prime }$ of the input graph $G$ and then repeatedly contract safe edges in $G ^ { prime }$ ; the minimum spanning tree consists of the contracted edges. \n• Borůvka: Mark the lightest edge leaving each vertex, contract all marked edges, and recurse. • Jarník: Repeatedly contract the lightest edge incident to some fixed root vertex. • Kruskal: Repeatedly contract the lightest edge in the graph.   \n(a) Describe an algorithm to execute a single pass of Borůvka’s contraction algorithm in $O ( V + E )$ time. The input graph is represented in an adjacency list.   \n(b) Consider an algorithm that first performs $k$ passes of Borůvka’s contraction algorithm, and then runs Jarník’s algorithm (with a Fibonacci heap) on the resulting contracted graph. i. What is the running time of this hybrid algorithm, as a function of $V , E$ , and $k ?$ ii. For which value of $k$ is this running time minimized? What is the resulting running time? \n(c) Call a family of graphs nice if it has the following properties: \n• Contracting an edge of a nice graph yields another nice g • Every nice graph with $V$ vertices has only $O ( V )$ edges. \nFor example, planar graphs—graphs that can be drawn in the plane with no crossing edges—are nice. Contracting any edge of a planar graph leaves a smaller planar graph, and Euler’s formula implies that every planar graph with $V$ vertices has at most $3 V - 6$ edges. \nProve that Borůvka’s contraction algorithm computes the minimum spanning tree of any nice graph in $O ( V )$ time. \n9. Consider a path between two vertices $s$ and $t$ in a undirected weighted graph $G$ . The width of this path is the minimum weight of any edge in the path. The bottleneck distance between s and $t$ is the width of the widest path from $s$ to $t$ . (If there are no paths from $s$ to $t$ , the bottleneck distance is $- infty$ ; on the other hand, the bottleneck distance from $s$ to itself is $infty$ .) \n(a) Prove that the maximum spanning tree of $G$ contains widest paths between every pair of vertices. \n(b) Describe an algorithm to solve the following problem in $O ( V + E )$ time: Given a undirected weighted graph $G$ , two vertices $s$ and $t$ , and a weight $W$ , is the bottleneck distance between $s$ and $t$ at most W ?   \n(c) Suppose $B$ is the bottleneck distance between $s$ and $t$ . i. Prove that deleting any edge with weight less than $B$ does not change the bottleneck distance between $s$ and $t$ . ii. Prove that contracting any edge with weight greater than $B$ does not change the bottleneck distance between $s$ and $t$ . (If contraction creates parallel edges, delete all but the heaviest edge between each pair of nodes.)   \nn(d) Describe an algorithm to compute a minimum-bottleneck path between s and $t$ in $O ( V + E )$ time. [Hint: Start by finding the median-weight edge in G.] \n10. Borůvka’s algorithm can be reformulated to use a standard disjoint-set data structure to identify safe edges, just like Kruskal’s algorithm, instead of explicitly counting and labeling components of the evolving spanning forest $F$ in each iteration. \nIn this variant, each component of $F$ is represented by an up-tree; each vertex $nu$ stores a pointer parent $( nu )$ to its parent, or to $nu$ itself if $nu$ is the root of its up-tree. The subroutine $mathrm { F I N D } left( nu right)$ returns the root of $nu ^ { prime } s$ up-tree, but also applies path compression, reassigning all parent pointers from $nu$ to the root to point directly to the root, to speed up future Find operations.7 The subroutine Union combines two up-trees into one by making one of the two root nodes the parent of the other.8 \nIn the modified version of Borůvka’s algorithm, in addition to the parent pointers, the root vertex $bar { nu }$ of each component of $F$ maintains an edge safe $( bar { nu } )$ , which (at the end of FindSafeEdges) is the lightest edge with one endpoint in that component. \nProve that each call to FindSafeEdges and AddSafeEdges requires only $O ( E )$ time. [Hint: What is the depth of the up-trees when FindSafeEdges ends?] It follows that this variant of Borůvka also runs in $O ( E log V )$ time. \nI study my Bible as I gather apples. First I shake the whole tree, that the ripest might fall. Then I climb the tree and shake each limb, and then each branch and then each twig, and then I look under each leaf. \n— attributed to Martin Luther (c. 1500) \nLife is an unfoldment, and the further we travel the more truth we can comprehend. To understand the things that are at our door is the best preparation for understanding those that lie beyond. \n— attributed to Hypatia of Alexandria (c. 400) by Elbert Hubbard in Little Journeys to the Homes of Great Teachers (1908) \nYour mind will answer most questions if you learn to relax and wait for the answer.   \nLike one of those thinking machines, you feed in your question, sit back, and wait ... \n— William S. Burroughs, Naked Lunch (1959) \nThe methods given in this paper require no foresight or ingenuity, and hence deserve to be called algorithms. \n— Edward R. Moore, “The Shortest Path Through a Maze” (1959) \nShortest Paths \nSuppose we are given a weighted directed graph $G = left( V , E , w right)$ with two special vertices, and we want to find the shortest path from a source vertex $s$ to a target vertex t. That is, we want to find the directed path $P$ starting at $s$ and ending at $t$ that minimizes the function \nFor example, if I want to answer the question “What’s the fastest way to drive from my old apartment in Champaign, Illinois to my wife’s old apartment in Columbus, Ohio?”, I might use a graph whose vertices are cities, edges are roads, weights are driving times, s is Champaign, and $t$ is Columbus.1 The graph is directed, because driving times along the same road might be different in different directions.

For example, the weight of an edge might represent the cost of moving from one vertex to another, so negative-weight edges represent transitions with negative cost, or equivalently, transitions that earn a profit. \n\nNegative edges are a thorn in the side of most shortest-path problems, because the presence of a negative cycle might imply that shortest paths may not be well-defiend. To be precise, a shortest path from s to $t$ exists if and only if there is at least one path from $s$ to $t$ , but there is no path from $s$ to $t$ that touches a negative cycle. For any path from s to $t$ that touches a negative cycle, there is a shorter path from $s$ to $t$ that goes around the cycle one more time.2 Thus, if at least one path from $s$ to $t$ touches a negative cycle, there is no shortest path from $s$ to $t$ . \nIn part because we need to consider negative edge weights, this chapter explicitly considers only directed graphs. All of the algorithms described here also work for undirected graphs with essentially trivial modifications, if and only if negative edges are prohibited. Correctly handling negative edges in undirected graphs is considerably more subtle. We cannot simply replace every undirected edge with a pair of directed edges, because this would transform any negative edge into a short negative cycle. Subpaths of an undirected shortest path that contains a negative edge are not necessarily shortest paths; consequently, the set of all undirected shortest paths from a single source vertex may not define a tree, even if shortest paths are unique. \nA complete treatment of undirected graphs with negative edges is beyond the scope of this book. I will only mention, for people who want to follow up via Google, that a single shortest path in an undirected graph with negative edges can be computed in $O ( V E + V ^ { 2 } log V )$ time, by a reduction to maximum weighted matching. \n8.3 The Only SSSP Algorithm \nJust like graph traversal and minimum spanning trees, many different SSSP algorithms can be described as special cases of a single generic algorithm, first proposed by Lester Ford in 1956 and independently described by George Dantzig in $1 9 5 7 ^ { 3 }$ and again by George Minty in 1958.

We can correct (or at least improve) this obvious overestimate b\u0001y relaxing the edge as follows: \nNow that everything is set up, Ford’s generic algorithm has a simple one-line description: \nRepeatedly relax tense edges, until there are no more tense edges. \nFordSSSP(s): InitSSSP(s) while there is at least one tense edge Relax any tense edge \nIf FordSSSP eventually terminates (because there are no more tense edges), then the predecessor pointers correctly define a shortest-path tree, and each value $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is the actual shortest-path distance from s to $nu$ . In particular, if $s$ cannot reach $nu$ , then $d i s t ( nu ) = infty$ , and if any negative cycle is reachable from $s$ , then the algorithm never terminates. \nThe correctness of Ford’s generic algorithm follows from the following series of simpler claims: \n1. At any moment during the execution of the algorithm, for every vertex $nu$ , the distance $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is either $infty$ or the length of a walk from $s$ to $nu$ . This claim can be proved by induction on the number of relaxations.   \n2. If the graph has no negative cycles, then $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is either $infty$ or the length of some simple path from $s$ to $nu$ . Specifically, if $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is the length of a walk from s to $nu$ that contains a directed cycle, that cycle must have negative length. This claim implies that if $G$ has no negative cycles, the relaxation algorithm eventually halts, because there are only a finite number of simple paths in $G$ .   \n3. If no edge in $G$ is tense, then for every vertex $nu$ , the distance $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is the length of the predecessor path $s to cdots p r e d ( p r e d ( nu ) ) { to } p r e d ( nu ) { to } nu$ . Specifically, if $nu$ violates this condition bu\u0001t its predecessor p\u0001red $( nu )$ do\u0001es not, the edge pred $( nu ) to nu$ is tense.   \n4. If no edge in $G$ is tens\u0001e, then for every vertex $nu$ , the path of predecessor edges $s to cdots to p r e d ( p r e d ( nu ) ) { to } p r e d ( nu ) { to } nu$ is in fact a shortest path from s to $nu$ . Sp\u0001ecific\u0001ally, if $nu$ violates\u0001this cond\u0001ition but its predecessor $u$ in some shortest path does not, the edge $u {  } nu$ is tense. This claim also implies that if $G$ has a negative cycle, then\u0001 some edge is always tense, so the generic algorithm never halts. \nSo far I haven’t said anything about how to find tense edges, or which tense edge(s) to relax if there is more than one. Just like whatever-first search, there are several different instantiations of Ford’s generic relaxation algorithm. Unlike whatever-first search, however, the efficiency and correctness of each search strategy depends on the structure of the input graph. \n\nThe rest of this chapter considers the four most common instantiations of Ford’s algorithm, each of which is the best choice for a different class of input graphs. I’ll leave the remaining details of the generic correctness proof as exercises, and instead give (more informative, self-contained) correctness proofs for each of these four specific algorithms. \n8.4 Unweighted Graphs: Breadth-First Search \nIn the simplest special case of the shortest path problem, all edges have weight 1, and the length of a path is just the number of edges. This special case can be solved by a species of our generic graph-traversal algorithm called breadth-first search. Breadth-first search is often attributed to Edward Moore, who described it in 1957 (as “Algorithm A”) as the first published method to find the shortest path through a maze.4 Especially in the context of VLSI wiring and robot path planning, breadth-first search is sometimes attributed to Chin Yang Lee, who described several applications of Moore’s “Algorithm A” (with proper credit to Moore) in 1961.

However, in 1945, more than a decade before Moore considered mazes, Konrad Zuse described an implementation of breadth-first search, as a method to count and label the components of a disconnected graph.6 \nBreadth-first search maintains a first-in-first-out queue of vertices, which initially contains only the source vertex s. At each iteration, the algorithm Pulls a vertex $u$ from the front of the queue and examines each of its outgoing edges $u {  } nu$ . Whenever the algorithm discovers an outgoing tense edge $u {  } nu$ , it relaxes th\u0001at edge and Pushes vertex $nu$ onto the queue. The algorithm en\u0001ds when the queue becomes empty. \nBreadth-first search is somewhat easier to analyze if we break its execution into phases, by introducing an imaginary token. Before we Pull any vertices, we Push the token into the queue. The current phase ends when we Pull the token out of the queue; we begin the next phase when we Push the token into the queue again. Thus, the first phase consists entirely of scanning the source vertex s. The algorithm ends when the queue contains only the token. The modified algorithm is shown in Figure 8.5, and Figure 8.6 shows an example of this algorithm in action. Let me emphasize that these modifications are merely a convenience for analysis; with or without the token, the algorithm Pushes and Pulls vertices in the same order, scans edges in the same order, and outputs exactly the same distances and predecessors. \nLet me emphasize that in the following lemma, $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is just a variable maintained by the algorithm. While $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ intuitively represents a tentative shortest-path distance, we cannot assume (yet) that $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is ever actually equal to the true shortest-path distance from $s$ to $nu$ . Don’t worry; we’ll get there. \nLemma 8.1. For every integer $i geq 0$ and every vertex $nu$ , at the end of the ith phase, either di $s t ( nu ) = infty$ or d $dot { iota } s t ( nu ) leq i$ , and $nu$ is in the queue if and only if $d i s t ( nu ) = i$ . \nProof: The proof proceeds by induction on i. The base case $i = 0$ is straightforward: At the start of the first phase (“at the end of the zeroth phase”), the queue contains only the start vertex $s$ and the token $star$ , and InitSSSP just set $d i s t ( s ) gets 0$ and $d i s t ( nu ) gets infty$ for all $nu neq s$ . \nSo fix an integer $i > 0$ . The inductive hypothesis implies that at the start of the ith phase, the queue contains every vertex $u$ with $d i s t ( u ) = i - 1$ , followed by the token ✠. In other words, the queue looks like this: \nThus, before we Pull the token ✠ from the queue, ending the ith phase, we Pull every vertex $u$ with $d i s t ( u ) = i - 1$ . \nFor each such vertex $u$ , we consider every outgoing edge $u {  } nu$ . If $u {  } nu$ is tense, we set $d i s t ( nu ) gets d i s t ( u ) + 1$ , so that $d i s t ( nu ) = i$ , and then\u0001immedi\u0001ately \nPush $nu$ into the queue. These are the only assignments to distance labels during the ith phase. Thus, by induction, during the entire ith phase, the queue contains some vertices with distance label $i - 1$ , followed by the token, followed by some vertices with distance label $i$ : \nIn particular, just before the ith phase ends, the queue contains the token, followed by some vertices with distance label $i$ . \ni i i ✠\nMoreover, vertex $nu$ appears in this final queue if and only if $d i s t ( nu )$ was changed during the ith phase. Thus, at the end of the ith phase, the queue contains every vertex $nu$ with $d i s t ( nu ) = i$ . □ \nLemma 8.1 implies that the main body of BFS assigns distance labels in nondecreasing order; on the other hand, the distance label $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ of each vertex $nu$ never increases. It follows that for each vertex $nu$ , the line $mathbf {  } ^ { boldsymbol { mathfrak { c } } iota } d i s t ( nu ) gets d i s t ( u ) + boldsymbol { 1 } ^ { , , }$ is executed at most once, during phase dist $( nu )$ . Similarly: \n• Each predecessor pointer pred $( nu )$ is changed at most once, during phase dist $( nu )$ .   \n• Each vertex $nu$ is Pushed into the queue at most once, during phase $boldsymbol { d i s t } ( nu )$ .   \n• Each vertex $u$ is Pulled from the queue at most once, during phase d $l i s t ( u ) + 1$ .   \n• For each edge $u {  } nu$ , the comparison “is $d i s t ( nu ) > d i s t ( u ) + 1 \"$ is performed at most once, dur\u0001ing phase $begin{array} { r } { d i s t ( u ) + 1 } end{array}$ . \nAltogether, these observations imply that breadth-first search runs in $O ( V + E )$ time. Intuitively, we can think of the vertices in the queue as a “wavefront” expanding monotonically outward from the source vertex $s$ , passing over each vertex and edge of the graph at most once. This expanding wavefront analogy was already proposed by Chin Yang Lee in 1961, inspired by visualizations produced by his implementation of Moore’s Algorithm A. \nThese observations also imply that we can replace the condition “if $d i s t ( nu ) >$ $begin{array} { r } { d i s t ( u ) + 1 ^ { prime prime } } end{array}$ by the (arguably) simpler test “if $d i s t ( nu ) = infty ^ { prime prime }$ . Then distances play the same role as the marks maintained by other graph-traversal algorithms, which ensure that each vertex is visited only once. Specifically, a vertex is “marked” if and only if its distance label is finite. \nBut we still need to prove that the final distance labels are correct! \nTheorem 8.2. When BFS ends, $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is the length of the shortest path in $G$ from s to $nu$ , for every vertex $nu$ . \nProof: Fix an arbitrary vertex $nu$ , and consider an arbitrary path $nu _ { 0 } {  } nu _ { 1 } {  } cdots {  } nu _ { ell }$ in $G$ , where $nu _ { 0 } = s$ and $nu _ { ell } = nu$ .

Whenever these other shortest-path algorithms consider a vertex, they attempt to relax each of its outgoing edges, intuitively pushing the wavefront forward from the source; whereas, DagSSSP attempts to relax each of the incoming edges of each vertex, intuitively pulling the wavefront forward. \nHowever, if we modify DagSSSP to relax outgoing edges instead of incoming edges, we obtain another algorithm that computes shortest paths in dags in $O ( V + E )$ time and that more closely resembles our other shortest-path algorithms. \nPushDagSSSP(s): InitSSSP(s) for all vertices $boldsymbol { u }$ in topological order for all outgoing edges $u {  } nu$ if $u {  } nu$ is tense $operatorname { R E L A X } ( u to nu )$ \nFigure 8.10 shows an execution of this modified algorithm on the same graph as Figure 8.9.

The same algorithm was independently discovered by Edsger Dijkstra in 1956 (but not published until 1959), again by George Minty some time before 1960, and again by Peter Whiting and John Hillier in 1960. A nearly identical algorithm was also described by George Dantzig in 1958. Although several early sources called it “Minty’s algorithm”, this approach is now universally known as “Dijkstra’s algorithm”, in full accordance with Stigler’s Law.7 Pseudocode for this algorithm is shown in Figure 8.11. \nAn easy induction proof implies that, at all times during the execution of this algorithm, an edge $u {  } nu$ is tense if and only if vertex $u$ is either in the priority",

Thus, Dijkstra’s algorithm is an instance of Ford’s general strategy, which implies that it correctly computes shortest paths, provided there are no negative cycles in $G$ . \nNo Negative Edges \nDijkstra’s algorithm is particularly well-behaved when the input graph has no negative-weight edges. In this setting, the algorithm intuitively expands a wavefront outward from the source vertex s, passing over vertices in increasing order of their distance from s, similarly to breadth-first search. Figure 8.12 shows the algorithm in action. \nWe can derive a self-contained proof of correctness for Dijkstra’s algorithm in this setting by formalizing this wavefront intuition. For each integer $i$ , let $u _ { i }$ denote the vertex returned by the ith call to ExtractMin, and let $d _ { i }$ be the value of $d i s t ( u _ { i } )$ just after this Extraction. In particular, we have $u _ { 1 } = s$ and $d _ { 1 } = 0$ . We cannot assume at this point that the vertices $u _ { i }$ are distinct; in principle, the same vertex might be Extracted more than once. \nLemma 8.3. If $G$ has no negative-weight edges, then for all $i < j$ , we have $d _ { i } leq d _ { j }$ . \nProof: Assume $G$ has no negative weight edges. Fix an arbitrary index $i$ ; to prove the lemma, it suffices to prove that $d _ { i + 1 } geq d _ { i }$ . There are two cases to consider. \n• If $G$ contains the edge $u _ { i } {  } u _ { i + 1 }$ , and this edge is relaxed during the ith iteration of the main loop,\u0001then at the end of the ith iteration, we have $d i s t ( u _ { i + 1 } ) = d i s t ( u _ { i } ) + w ( u _ { i } to u _ { i + 1 } ) geq d i s t ( u _ { i } )$ , because all edge weights are non-negative.   \n• Otherwise, at the start of the ith iteration, $u _ { i + 1 }$ must already be in the priority queue, and it must have priority $d i s t ( u _ { i + 1 } ) geq d i s t ( u _ { i } )$ , because $u _ { i }$ is the vertex returned by ExtractMin. Moreover, $d i s t ( u _ { i + 1 } )$ does not change during the ith iteration. \nIn both cases, we conclude that $d _ { i + 1 } geq d _ { i }$ . The lemma now follows immediately by induction on i. □ \nLemma 8.4. If G has no negative-weight edges, each vertex of $G$ is Extracted from the priority queue at most once. \nProof: Suppose $nu$ is Extracted more than once. Specifically, suppose $nu$ is Extracted in the ith iteration of the main loop, reInserted during the $j$ th iteration, and reExtracted during the $k$ th iteration, for some indices $i < j < k$ . Then in the notation of the previous proof, we have v = ui = uk. \nThe distance label $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ never increases. Moreover, $mathrm { Delta } d i s t ( nu )$ strictly decreases during the jth iteration, just before $nu$ is reInserted. It follows that $d _ { i } > d _ { k }$ . Therefore, by the previous lemma, $G$ has at least one negative-weight edge. □ \nLemma 8.4 immediately implies that each vertex is scanned at most once, and thus that each edge is relaxed at most once. However, unlike in breadth-first search, each distance label $operatorname { d } i s t ( nu )$ can change multiple times. The first time $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ changes from $infty$ , we Insert $nu$ into the priority queue; after that, each change to $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is followed by a call to DecreaseKey. After $nu$ is Extracted from the priority queue, its distance label never changes. \nThe rest of the correctness proof is almost identical to breadth-first search. \nTheorem 8.5. If G has no negative-weight edges, then when Dijkstra ends, $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is the length of the shortest path in $G$ from s to $nu$ , for every vertex $nu$ . \nProof: Fix an arbitrary vertex $nu$ , and consider an arbitrary path $nu _ { 0 } {  } nu _ { 1 } {  } cdots {  } nu _ { ell }$ in $G$ , where $nu _ { 0 } = s$ and $nu _ { ell } = nu$ . For any index $j$ , let $L _ { j }$ denote the l\u0001engt\u0001h of\u0001the subpath $nu _ { 0 } {  } nu _ { 1 } {  } cdots {  } nu _ { j }$ . We prove by induction that $d i s t ( nu _ { j } ) leq L _ { j }$ for all $j$ . \n• Trivially\u0001 $d i s t ( nu _ { 0 } ) = d i s t ( s ) = 0 = L _ { 0 }$ .   \n• For any index $j > 0$ , the induction hypothesis implies $d i s t ( nu _ { j - 1 } ) leq L _ { j - 1 }$ . Immediately after we Pull vertex $nu _ { j - 1 }$ from the queue, either $d i s t ( nu _ { i } ) leq$ $d i s t ( nu _ { j - 1 } ) + w ( nu _ { j - 1 }  nu _ { j } )$ already, or we set $d i s t ( nu _ { i } ) gets d i s t ( nu _ { j - 1 } ) + w ( nu _ { j - 1 } {  } nu _ { j } )$ . In either case, we h\u0001ave \nWe just proved that $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is at most the length of every path from s to $nu$ ; it follows that $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is at most the length of the shortest path from $s$ to $nu$ . \nOn the other hand, a similar induction proof implies that $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is the length of the predecessor path $s to cdots to p r e d ( p r e d ( nu ) ) { to } p r e d ( nu ) { to } nu$ . □ \nIt remains only to bound the algorithm’s running time. Altogether Dijkstra performs at most $E$ DecreaseKey operations, and at most $V$ Insert and ExtractMin operations. Thus, if we implement the underlying priority queue using a standard binary heap, which supports each operation in $O ( log V )$ time, Dijkstra runs in $ { boldsymbol { O } } ( E log V )$ time.8 \nIf we know in advance that our input graphs will never have negative edges, we can simplify Dijkstra’s algorithm slightly, by Inserting every vertex into the priority queue in the initialization phase, and then only calling DecreaseKey in the main loop, as shown in Figure 8.13. This is the version of Dijkstra’s algorithm presented by most algorithms textbooks, Wikipedia, and even Dijkstra’s original paper; it’s also the version of Dijkstra’s algorithm that I described as “best-first search” in Chapter 5. \nNonnegativeDijkstra(s): InitSSSP(s) for all vertices v Insert(v, dist(v)) while the priority queue is not empty $u gets mathrm { E x T R A C T M I N } ( )$ for all edges $u {  } nu$ if $u {  } nu$ is t\u0001ense $begin{array} { r l } & { mathrm { R E L A X } ( u to nu ) }  & { underline { { mathrm { D E C R E A S E K E Y } } } ( nu , d i s t ( nu ) ) } end{array}$ \nnNegative Edges \nHowever, NonnegativeDijkstra does not correctly compute shortest paths in graphs with negative edges.

The same vertex can be Extracted multiple times; the same edge can be relaxed multiple times; and distances might not be discovered in increasing order. Figure 8.15 shows an example execution where the top left vertex is Extracted six times, and the top three edges are each relaxed twice. \nFor graphs without negative cycles, but no other restrictions on edge weights, the worst-case running time of Dijkstra is actually exponential. Figure 8.14 shows particularly simple family of graphs (due to Douglas Shier and Christoph Witzgall) that forces Dijkstra to perform $Theta ( 2 ^ { V / 2 } )$ relaxations.9 A more complex family of graphs (which I’ll leave as an exercise) forces $Theta ( 2 ^ { V } )$ relaxations, which is the worst possible. In practice, however, Dijkstra’s algorithm is usually fast even for graphs with negative edges. \n8.7 Relax ALL the Edges: Bellman-Ford \nThe simplest implementation of Ford’s generic shortest-path algorithm was first sketched by Alfonso Shimbel in 1954, described in more detail by Edward Moore in 1957, and independently rediscovered by Max Woodbury and George Dantzig in 1957, by Richard Bellman in 1958, and by George Minty in 1958. (Neither Woodbury and Dantzig nor Minty published their algorithms.) In full compliance with Stigler’s Law, the algorithm is almost universally known as Bellman-Ford,10 because Bellman explicitly used Ford’s 1956 formulation of relaxing edges, although some authors refer to “Bellman-Kalaba”11 and a few early sources refer to “Bellman-Shimbel”.",

        "content": "In both cases, we conclude that $d i s t ( nu ) leq d i s t _ { leq i } ( nu )$ at the end of the ith iteration. □ \nIf the input graph has no negative cycles, the shortest walk from s to any other vertex is a simple path with at most $V - 1$ edges; it follows that BellmanFord halts with the correct shortest-path distances after at most $V - 1$ iterations. Said differently, if any edge is still tense after $V - 1$ iterations, then the input graph must contain a negative cycle! Thus, we can rewrite the algorithm more concretely as follows: \nEach iteration of the inner loop trivially requires $O ( E )$ time, so the overall algorithm runs in $O ( V E )$ time. Thus, Bellman-Ford is always efficient, even if the graph has negative edges, and in fact even if the graph has negative cycles. \nIf all edge weights are non-negative, however, Dijkstra’s algorithm is faster, at least in the worst case. (In practice, Dijkstra’s algorithm is often faster than Bellman-Ford even for graphs with negative edges.) \nMoore’s Improvement \nNeither Moore nor Bellman described the Bellman-Ford algorithm in the form I’ve presented here. Moore presented his version of the algorithm (\"Algorithm D\") in the same paper that proposed breadth-first search (\"Algorithm A\") for unweighted graphs; indeed, the two algorithms are nearly identical. Although Moore’s algorithm has the same $O ( V E )$ worst-case running time as BellmanFord, it is often significantly faster in practice, intuitively because it avoids checking edges that are “obviously” not tense. \nMoore derived his weighted shortest-path algorithm by making two modifications to breadth-first search. First, replace each $^ { ast } { + } 1 ^ { ast }$ with $^ { mathfrak { a } } { + } w ( u { to } nu ) ^ { mathfrak { N } }$ in the innermost loop, to take the edge weights into account. Second, chec\u0001k whether a vertex is already in the FIFO queue before Inserting it, so that the queue always contains at most one copy of each vertex.13 \nFollowing our earlier analysis of breadth-first search, I’ll introduce a “token” ✠ to break the execution of the algorithm into phases. Just like breadth-first search, each phase begins when the token is Pushed into the queue, and ends when the token is Pulled out of the queue again. Just like BFS, the algorithm ends when the queue contains only the token. The resulting algorithm is shown in Figure 8.16. \nMoore(s): InitSSSP(s) Push(s) Push(✠) start the first phase while the queue contains at least one vertex $u gets mathrm { P U L L ( ) }$ if $u = Psi$ Push(✠) start the next phase else for all edges $u {  } nu$ if $u {  } nu$ is t\u0001ense $operatorname { R E L A X } ( u to nu )$ if $nu$ is not\u0001already in the queue $mathtt { P U S H } ( nu )$ \nBecause the queue contains at most one copy of each vertex at any time, each vertex is Pulled from the queue at most once in each phase, and therefore each edge $u {  } nu$ is checked for tenseness at most once in each phase. Moreover, every edge t\u0001hat is tense when a phase begins is relaxed during that phase. (Some edges that become tense during the phase might also be relaxed during that phase, and some relaxed edges might become tense again in the same phase.) Thus, Moore can be viewed as a refinement of BellmanFord that uses a queue to maintain tense edges, rather than testing every edge by brute force. In particular, a similar inductive proof establishes the following analogue of Lemma 8.6: \nLemma 8.7. For every vertex $nu$ and non-negative integer i, after i phases of Moore, we have dist $( nu ) leq d i s t _ { leq i } ( nu )$ . \nThus, if the input graph has no negative cycles, Moore halts after at most $V - 1$ phases. In each phase, we scan each vertex at most once, so we relax each edge at most once, so the worst-case running time of a single phase is $O ( E )$ . Thus, the overall running time of Moore is $O ( V E )$ . In practice, however, Moore often computes shortest paths considerably faster than BellmanFord, because it only scans an edge $u {  } nu$ if $operatorname { d i s t } ( u )$ was changed in the previous phase. \nIf the input graph contains a\u0001negative cycle, Moore never halts. Fortunately, like BellmanFord, it is easy to modify Moore’s algorithm to report negative cycles if they exist. Perhaps the easiest modification is to actually maintain a token, and count the number of times the token is Pulled from the queue. Then the input graph contains a negative cycle if and only if the queue is non-empty immediately after the token is Pulled for the $( V - 1 )$ th time. \n\nDynamic Programming Formulation \nLike almost everything else with his name on it, Richard Bellman derived the “Bellman-Ford” shortest-path algorithm via dynamic programming. As usual, we need to start with a recursive definition of shortest path distances. It’s tempting to use the same identity that we exploited for directed acyclic graphs: \nUnfortunately, if the input graph is not a dag, this recurrence doesn’t work! Suppose the input graph contains the directed cycle $u {  } nu {  } w {  } u$ .

If the input graph has any directed cycles, we get stuck in an infinite loop! \nTo support a proper recurrence, we need to add an additional structural parameter to the distance function, which decreases monotonically at each recursive call, defined so that the function is trivial to evaluate when the parameter reaches 0. Bellman chose the maximum number of edges as this additional parameter.14 \nAs in our earlier analysis, let dist $leq _ { i } ( nu )$ denote the length of the shortest walk from $s$ to $nu$ consisting of at most i edges. Bellman observed that this function obeys the following Bellman’s equation recurrence: \nLet’s assume that the graph has no negative cycles, so our goal is to compute $d i s t _ { le V - 1 } ( nu )$ for every vertex $nu$ . Here is a straightforward dynamic-programming evaluation of this recurrence, where $boldsymbol { d i s t } [ i , nu ]$ stores the value of $d i s t _ { leq i } ( nu )$ . Correctness of the final shortest-path distances follows from the correctness of the recurrence, and the $O ( V E )$ running time is obvious. This is essentially how Bellman presented his shortest-path algorithm. \nWe can transform this dynamic programming algorithm into our original formulation of BellmanFord through a short series of minor optimizations. First, each iteration of the outermost loop considers each edge $u {  } nu$ exactly once, but the order in which we consider those edges doesn’t actuall\u0001y matter. Thus, we can safely remove one level of indentation from the last three lines! The modified algorithm may consider edges in a different order, but it still correctly computes $d i s t _ { leq i } ( nu )$ for all $i$ and $nu$ . \nNext we change the indices in the last two lines from $i - 1$ to $i$ . This change may cause the distances $mathrm {  d } i s t { } [ i , nu ]$ to approach the true shortest-path distances more quickly than before, but the algorithm correctly computes the true shortest path distances. Instead of $d i s t [ i , nu ] = d i s t _ { leq i } ( nu )$ , we now have $d i s t [ i , nu ] leq d i s t _ { leq i } ( nu )$ for all $i$ and $nu$ , mirroring Lemmas 8.6 and 8.7. \nBut this algorithm is a little silly. In the ith iteration of the outermost loop, we first copy the $( i - 1 ) mathrm { t h }$ row of the array $d i s t [ cdot , cdot ]$ to the ith row, and then modify the elements of the ith row. So we really don’t need a two-dimensional array at all; the iteration index $i$ is completely redundant! In our final modification, we maintain only a one-dimensional array of tentative distances. \nThis final dynamic programming algorithm is almost identical to our original formulation of BellmanFord! The first three lines initialize the shortest path distances, and the last two lines relax the edge $u {  } nu$ if that edge is tense. \nBellmanFordFinal is missing only two features of our earlier formulation: It does not maintain predecessor pointers or detect negative cycles. Fortunately, adding those features is straightforward. \nExercises \n0.

A looped tree is a weighted, directed graph built from a binary tree by adding an edge from every leaf back to the root. Every edge has non-negative weight. \n(a) How much time would Dijkstra’s algorithm require to compute the shortest path between two vertices $u$ and $nu$ in a looped tree with $n$ nodes?   \n(b) Describe and analyze a faster algorithm. \n2. Suppose we are given a directed graph $G$ with weighted edges and two vertices $s$ and $t$ . \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the shortest path from s to $t$ when exactly one edge in $G$ has negative weight. [Hint: Modify Dijkstra’s algorithm. Or don’t.] \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ when exactly $k$ edges in $G$ have negative weight. How does the running time of your algorithm depend on $k ?$ \n3. Suppose we are given an undirected graph $G$ in which every vertex has a positive weight. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find a spanning tree of $G$ with minimum total weight. (The total weight of a spanning tree is the sum of the weights of its vertices.)   \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find a path in $G$ from one given vertex s to another given vertex t with minimum total weight. (The total weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its vertices.) \n[Hint: One of these problems is trivial.] \n4. For any edge $e$ in any graph $G$ , let $G setminus e$ denote the graph obtained by deleting $e$ from $G$ . Suppose we are given a graph $G$ and two vertices s and t. The replacement paths problem asks us to compute the shortest-path distance from $s$ to $t$ in $G setminus e$ , for every edge $e$ of $G$ . The output is an array of $E$ distances, one for each edge of $G$ . \n(a) Suppose $G$ is a directed graph, and the shortest path from vertex s to vertex $t$ passes through every vertex of $G$ . Describe an algorithm to solve this special case of the replacement paths problem in $O ( E log V )$ time.   \nn(b) Describe an algorithm to solve the replacement paths problem for arbitrary undirected graphs in $O ( E log V )$ time. \nIn both subproblems, you may assume that all edge weights are non-negative. [Hint: If we delete an edge of the original shortest path, how do the old and new shortest paths overlap?] \n5. Let $G = ( V , E )$ be a connected directed graph with non-negative edge weights, let $s$ and $t$ be vertices of $G$ , and let $H$ be a subgraph of $G$ obtained by deleting some edges. Suppose we want to reinsert exactly one edge from $G$ back into $H$ , so that the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ in the resulting graph is as short as possible. Describe and analyze an algorithm that chooses the best edge to reinsert, in $O ( E log V )$ time. \n6. (a) Describe and analyze a modification of Bellman-Ford that actually returns a negative cycle if any such cycle is reachable from s, or a shortest-path tree if there is no such cycle. The modified algorithm should still run in $O ( V E )$ time. \n(b) Describe and analyze a modification of Bellman-Ford that computes the correct shortest path distances from $s$ to every other vertex of the input graph, even if the graph contains negative cycles. Specifically, if any walk from $s$ to $nu$ contains a negative cycle, your algorithm should end with $d i s t ( nu ) = - infty$ ; otherwise, $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ should contain the length of the shortest path from $s$ to $nu$ . The modified algorithm should still run in $O ( V E )$ time.   \n(c) Repeat parts (a) and (b), but for Ford’s generic relaxation algorithm. You may assume that the unmodified algorithm halts in $O ( 2 ^ { V } )$ steps if there is no negative cycle; your modified algorithms should also run in $O ( 2 ^ { V } )$ time. \n7. Consider the following even looser variant of Ford’s generic relaxation algorithm: \nProve that if FellmanBored examines the edges of any walk $W$ starting from s, in order along $W$ , then the last distance label in $W$ is at most the length of $W$ . More formally: If the edges of any walk $nu _ { 0 } {  } nu _ { 1 } {  } cdots {  } nu _ { ell }$ where $nu _ { 0 } = s$ , define a subsequence of the edges $e _ { 1 } , e _ { 2 } , e _ { 3 } , ldots$ e\u0001xam\u0001ined\u0001by FellmanBored, then we have $begin{array} { r } { d i s t ( nu _ { ell } ) leq sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { ell } w ( nu _ { i - 1 } to nu _ { i } ) } end{array}$ . [Hint: This property is almost easier to prove than it is to state corr\u0001ectly.] \n8. This problem considers several ways to detect negative cycles using Ford’s generic relaxation algorithm. \n(a) Prove that if pred(s) ever changes after InitSSSP, then the input graph contains a negative cycle through s.   \n(b) Show that pred(s) might never change after InitSSSP, even when the input graph contains a negative cycle through s.   \n(c) Let $P$ denote the current graph of predecessor edges pred $( nu ) to nu$ , and let $X$ denote the set of all currently tense edges; both of these set\u0001s evolve as the algorithm executes. Prove that the input graph has no negative cycles if and only if $P cup X$ is always a dag.   \n(d) Let $R$ denote the set of all edges that have been relaxed so far; this set grows as the algorithm executes. Prove that the input graph has no negative cycles if and only if $R$ is always a dag. \nn9. Prove that Dijkstra’s algorithm performs $Omega ( 2 ^ { V } )$ relaxations in the worst case when edges are allowed to have negative weight, even if the underlying graph is acyclic. Specifically, for every positive integer $n$ , construct a $n$ -vertex dag $G _ { n }$ with weighted edges, such that Dijkstra’s algorithm calls Relax $Omega ( 2 ^ { n } )$ times when $G _ { n }$ is the input graph. [Hint: Binary counter.] \nn10. Prove that Ford’s generic relaxation algorithm (and therefore Dijkstra’s algorithm) halts after at most $O ( 2 ^ { V } )$ relaxations, unless the input graph contains a negative cycle. [Hint: See Problem $delta ( d ) . jmath$ \n11. Suppose you are given a directed graph $G$ in which every edge has negative weight, and a source vertex s. Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm that computes the shortest-path distances from s to every other vertex in $G$ . Specifically, for every vertex $t$ : \n• If $t$ is not reachable from s, your algorithm should report $d i s t ( t ) = infty$ . • If $G$ has a cycle that is reachable from s, and $t$ is reachable from that cycle, then the shortest-path distance from $s$ to $t$ is not well-defined, because there are paths (formally, walks) from s to $t$ of arbitrarily large negative length. In this case, your algorithm should report $d i s t ( t ) = - infty$ . • If neither of the two previous conditions applies, your algorithm should report the correct shortest-path distance from $s$ to $t$ . \n12. Although we typically speak of “the” shortest path between two nodes, single graph could contain several minimum-length paths with the same endpoints. Even for weighted graphs, it is often desirable to choose a minimum-weight path with the fewest edges; call this a best path from s to t. Suppose we are given a directed graph $G$ with positive edge weights and a source vertex s in $G$ . Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute best paths in $G$ from s to every other vertex. \n13. Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine the number of shortest paths from a source vertex s to a target vertex t in an arbitrary directed graph $G$ with weighted edges. You may assume that all edge weights are positive and that all necessary arithmetic operations can be performed in \n$O ( 1 )$ time. [Hint: Compute shortest path distances from s to every other vertex. Throw away all edges that cannot be part of a shortest path from s to another vertex. What’s left?] \n14. You just discovered your best friend from elementary school on Twitbook. You both want to meet as soon as possible, but you live in two different cites that are far apart. To minimize travel time, you agree to meet at an intermediate city, and then you simultaneously hop in your cars and start driving toward each other. But where exactly should you meet? \nYou are given a weighted graph $G = ( V , E )$ , where the vertices $V$ represent cities and the edges $E$ represent roads that directly connect cities. Each edge e has a weight $w ( e )$ equal to the time required to travel between the two cities. You are also given a vertex $p$ , representing your starting location, and a vertex $q$ , representing your friend’s starting location. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to find the target vertex $t$ that allows you and your friend to meet as quickly as possible. \n15. You are hired as a cyclist for the Giggle Highway View project, which will provide street-level images along the entire US national highway system. As a pilot project, you are asked to ride the Giggle Highway-View FixedGear Carbon-Fiber Bicycle from “the Giggleplex” in Portland, Oregon to “Gigglesburg” in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. \nYou are a hopeless caffeine addict, but like most Giggle employees you are also a coffee snob; you only drink independently roasted, hand-pulled, direct-trade, organic, shade-grown, single-origin espresso, unadulterated by milk or sugar, thank you very much. After each espresso shot, you can bike up to $L$ miles before suffering a caffeine-withdrawal migraine. \nGiggle helpfully provides you with a map of the United States, in the form of an undirected graph $G$ , whose vertices represent coffee shops that sell independently roasted hand-pulled direct-trade organic shade-grown singleorigin espresso, and whose edges represent highway connections between them. Each edge $e$ is labeled with the length $ell ( e )$ of the corresponding stretch of highway. Naturally, there are acceptable espresso stands at both Giggle offices, represented by two specific vertices s and $t$ in the graph $G$ . \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether it is possible to bike from the Giggleplex to Gigglesburg without suffering a caffeinewithdrawal migraine.   \n(b) You discover that by wearing a more expensive fedora, you can increase the distance $L$ that you can bike between espresso shots. Describe and analyze and algorithm to find the minimum value of $L$ that allows \nyou to bike from the Giggleplex to Gigglesburg without suffering a caffeine-withdrawal migraine. \n(c) When you report to your supervisor (whom Giggle recently hired away from their competitor Ünter) that the ride is impossible, she demands to look at your map. “Oh, I see the problem; there are no Starbucks on this map!” As you look on in horror, she hands you an updated graph $G ^ { prime }$ that includes a vertex for every Starbucks location in the United States, helpfully marked in Starbucks Green (Pantone® 3425 C). \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to find the minimum number of Starbucks locations you must visit to bike from the Giggleplex to Gigglesburg without suffering a caffeine-withdrawal migraine. More formally, your algorithm should find the minimum number of green vertices on any path in $G ^ { prime }$ from s to $t$ that uses only edges of length at most $L$ . \n16. Suppose you are given a directed graph $G = ( V , E )$ with non-negatively weighted edges and two vertices s and $t$ . Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the shortest walk in $G$ from s to $t$ (possibly repeating vertices and/or edges) whose number of edges is divisible by 3. \nFor example, given the graph shown below, with the indicated vertices s and $t$ , and with all edges having weight 1, your algorithm should return 6, which is the length of the walk $s {  } w {  } y {  } x {  } s {  } w {  } t$ has length 6. \n17. Suppose you are given a directed graph $G$ with non-negatively weighted edges, where some edges are red and the remaining edges are blue. Describe an algorithm to find the shortest walk in $G$ from one vertex s to another vertex $t$ in which no three consecutive edges have the same color. That is, if the walk contains two red edges in a row, the next edge must be blue, and if the walk contains two blue edges in a row, the next edge must be red. \nFor example, given the following graph as input, where every red edge has weight 1 and every blue edge has weight 2, your algorithm should return the integer 9, because the shortest legal walk from $s$ to $t$ is $s {  } a {  } b { Rightarrow } d {  } c { Rightarrow } a {  } b {  } c$ . \n18. Consider a directed graph $G$ , where each edge has a non-negative weight, and each edge is colored either red, white, or blue. A walk in $G$ is called a French flag walk if its sequence of edge colors is red, white, blue, red, white, blue, and so on. More formally, a walk $nu _ { 0 } {  } nu _ { 1 } {  } cdots {  } nu _ { k }$ is a French flag walk if, for every integer $i$ , the edge $nu _ { i } { to } nu _ { i + 1 }$ is\u0001red i\u0001f i m\u0001od $3 = 0$ , white if i mod $3 = 1$ , and blue if i mod $3 = 2$ . \nDescribe an algorithm to find the shortest French flag walks from one starting vertex s to every other vertex in $G$ . \n19. There are $n$ galaxies connected by $m$ intergalactic teleport-ways. Each teleport-way joins two galaxies and can be traversed in both directions. Also, each teleport-way e has an associated cost of $c ( e )$ dollars, where $c ( e )$ is a positive integer. A teleport-way can be used multiple times, but the toll must be paid every time it is used. \nJudy wants to travel from galaxy s to galaxy $t$ as cheaply as possible. However, she wants the total cost to be a multiple of five dollars, because carrying small change is not pleasant either. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum total cost of traveling from galaxy s to galaxy $t$ , subject to the restriction that the total cost is a multiple of five dollars.   \n(b) Solve part (a), but now assume that Judy has a coupon that allows her to use exactly one teleport-way for free. \n20. After moving to a new city, you decide to choose a walking route from your home to your new office. To get a good daily workout, your route must consist of an uphill path (for exercise) followed by a downhill path (to cool down), or just an uphill path, or just a downhill path. (You’ll walk the same path home, so you’ll get exercise one way or the other.) But you also want the shortest path that satisfies these conditions, so that you actually get to work on time. \nYour input consists of an undirected graph $G$ , whose vertices represent intersections and whose edges represent road segments, along with a start vertex s and a target vertex $t$ . Every vertex $nu$ has an associated value $h ( nu )$ , which is the height of that intersection above sea level, and each edge uv has an associated value $ell ( u nu )$ , which is the length of that road segment. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the shortest uphill–downhill walk from $s$ to $t$ . Assume all vertex heights are distinct.   \n(b) Now suppose we allow some or all vertex heights to be equal. Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the shortest “uphill then downhill” walk from $s$ to $t$ ; you may use flat edges in both the “uphill” and “downhill” portions of your walk. \n(c) Finally, suppose you discover that there is no path from s to $t$ with the structure you want. Describe an algorithm to find a path from $s$ to $t$ that alternates between “uphill” and “downhill” subpaths as few times as possible, and has minimum length among all such paths. \n21. After graduating from Sham-Poobanana University you accept a job with Aerophobes-R-Us, the leading traveling agency for people who hate to fly. Your job is to build a system to help customers plan airplane trips from one city to another. All of your customers are afraid of flying (and by extension, airports), so any trip you plan needs to be as short as possible. You know all the departure and arrival times of all the flights on the planet. \nSuppose one of your customers wants to fly from city $X$ to city $Y$ . Describe an algorithm to find a sequence of flights that minimizes the total time in transit—the length of time from the initial departure to the final arrival, including time at intermediate airports waiting for connecting flights. \n22. In Exercise 20 from Chapter 5, you designed an algorithm to decide whether a given acute-angle maze is solvable. In this problem, you will design algorithms to find the shortest walk through a given acute-angle maze, for two different definitions of \"length”. \nComplete each angle maze below by tracing a path from start to finish that has only acute angles. \nYour input is a connected undirected graph $G$ whose vertices are points in the plane and whose edges are line segments. Edges do not intersect, except at their endpoints. For example, a drawing of the letter X would have five vertices and four edges; the first maze above has 14 vertices and 21 edges. You are also given two vertices Start and Finish. \nA walk from Start to Finish in $G$ is valid if it contains only acute angles, or more formally, for any two consecutive edges $u {  } nu {  } w$ , either $angle u nu w = pi$ or $0 < angle u nu w < pi / 2$ . Assume you can determine in\u0001 $O ( 1 )$ time whether the angle between two given segments is straight, obtuse, right, or acute. \n(a) Describe an algorithm to compute a valid walk from Start to Finish that traverses as few segments as possible. (If your walk traverses the same segment twice, count it twice.)   \n(b) Describe an algorithm to compute a valid walk from Start to Finish that makes as few turns as possible. [Hint: This is not the same as part (a).] \n(c) Describe an algorithm to compute a valid walk from Start to Finish whose total Euclidean length is as small as possible. (Assume you can also compute the length of any segment in $O ( 1 )$ time.) \n23. After a grueling midterm at the See-Bull Center for Fake News Detection, you decide to take the bus home. Since you planned ahead, you have a schedule that lists the times and locations of every stop of every bus in Sham-Poobanana. Unfortunately, no single bus visits both the See-Bull Center and your home; you must change buses at least once. There are exactly $b$ different buses. Each bus starts at 12:00:01am, makes exactly $n$ stops, and finally stops running at 11:59:59pm. Buses always run exactly on schedule, and you have an accurate watch. Finally, you are far too tired to walk between bus stops. \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine the sequence of bus rides that gets you home as early as possible. Your goal is to minimize your arrival time, not the time you spend traveling.   \n(b) Oh, no! The midterm was held on Halloween, and the streets are infested with zombies! The Sham-Poobanana Mass Transit District doesn’t have the funding to add additional buses or install zombie-proof bus stops, especially for only one night a year. Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine a sequence of bus rides that minimizes the total time you spend waiting at bus stops; you don’t care how late you get home or how much time you spend on buses. (Assume you can wait inside the See-Bull Center until your first bus is just about to leave.) \n24. The first morning after returning from a glorious spring break, Alice wakes to discover that her car won’t start, so she has to get to her classes at Sham-Poobanana University by public transit. She has a complete transit schedule for Poobanana County. The bus routes are represented in the schedule by a directed graph $G$ , whose vertices represent bus stops and whose edges represent bus routes between those stops. For each edge $u {  } nu$ , the schedule records three positive real numbers: \n• $ell ( u {  } nu )$ is the length of the bus ride from stop $u$ to stop $nu$ (in minutes)   \n• $f ( u {  } nu )$ is the first time (in minutes past 12am) that a bus leaves stop $u$ for s\u0001top $nu$ .   \n• $Delta ( u { to } nu )$ is the time between successive departures from stop $u$ to stop $nu$ (in m\u0001inutes). \nThus, the first bus for this route leaves $u$ at time $f ( u {  } nu )$ and arrives at $nu$ at time $f ( u {  } nu ) { + } ell ( u {  } nu )$ , the second bus leaves $u$ at time $f ( u to nu ) { + } Delta ( u to nu )$ and arrives at $nu$ at time $f ( u {  } nu ) { + } Delta ( u {  } nu ) { + } ell ( u {  } nu ) .$ , the third b\u0001us leaves $u$ at time $f ( u to nu ) + 2 cdot Delta ( u to nu )$ and arrives at $nu$ at time $f ( u to nu ) + 2 cdot Delta ( u to nu ) + ell ( u to nu ) ,$ and\u0001so on. \n\nAlice wants to leaves from stop s (her home) at a certain time and arrive at stop $t$ (The See-Bull Center) as quickly as possible. If Alice arrives at a stop on one bus at the exact time that another bus is scheduled to leave, she can catch the second bus. Because she’s a student at SPU, Alice can ride the bus for free, so she doesn’t care how many times she has to change buses. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to find the earliest time Alice can reach her destination. Your input consists of the directed graph $G = left( V , E right)$ , the vertices s and $t$ , the values $ell ( e ) , f ( e ) , Delta ( e )$ for each edge $e in E$ , and Alice’s starting time (in minutes past 12am). \n[Hint: In this rare instance, it may be easier to modify the algorithm, instead of modifying the input graph.] \n25. Mulder and Scully have computed, for every road in the United States, the exact probability that someone driving on that road won’t be abducted by aliens. Agent Mulder needs to drive from Langley, Virginia to Area 51, Nevada. What route should he take so that he has the least chance of being abducted? \nMore formally, you are given a directed graph $G = ( V , E )$ , where every edge e has an independent safety probability $p ( e )$ . The safety of a path is the product of the safety probabilities of its edges. Design and analyze an algorithm to determine the safest path from a given start vertex s to a given target vertex $t$ . You may assume that all necessary arithmetic operations can be performed in O(1) time. \nFor example, with the probabilities shown above, if Mulder tries to drive directly from Langley to Area 51, he has a $5 0 %$ chance of getting there without being abducted. If he stops in Memphis, he has a $0 . 7 times 0 . 9 = 6 3 %$ chance of arriving safely. If he stops first in Memphis and then in Las Vegas, he has a $1 - 0 . 7 times 0 . 1 times 0 . 5 = 9 6 . 5 %$ chance of being abducted! (That’s how they got Elvis, you know.) \n$^ { * } 2 6$ . On an overnight camping trip in Sunnydale National Park, you are woken from a restless sleep by a scream. As you crawl out of your tent to investigate, a terrified park ranger runs out of the woods, covered in blood and clutching a crumpled piece of paper to his chest. As he reaches your tent, he gasps, “Get out. . . while. . . you. . . ”, thrusts the paper into your hands, and falls to the ground. Checking his pulse, you discover that the ranger is stone dead. \nYou look down at the paper and recognize a map of the park, drawn as an undirected graph, where vertices represent landmarks in the park, and edges represent trails between those landmarks. (Trails start and end at landmarks and do not cross.) You recognize one of the vertices as your current location; several vertices on the boundary of the map are labeled EXIT. \nOn closer examination, you notice that someone (perhaps the poor dead park ranger) has written a real number between 0 and 1 next to each vertex and each edge. A scrawled note on the back of the map indicates that a number next to an edge is the probability of encountering a vampire along the corresponding trail, and a number next to a vertex is the probability of encountering a vampire at the corresponding landmark. (Vampires can’t stand each other’s company, so you’ll never see more than one vampire on the same trail or at the same landmark.) The note warns you that stepping off the marked trails will result in a slow and painful death. \nYou glance down at the corpse at your feet. Yes, his death certainly looked painful. Wait, was that a twitch? Are his teeth getting longer? After driving a tent stake through the undead ranger’s heart, you wisely decide to immediately leave the park as fast as possible. \nDescribe and analyze an efficient algorithm to find a path from your current location to an arbitrary EXIT node, such that the total expected number of vampires encountered along the path is as small as possible. Be sure to account for both the vertex probabilities and the edge probabilities. [Hint: Even without the vertex probabilities, this is not the same as the previous problem!] \nThe tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout;   \nthe tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth;   \nthe journey of a thousand li commenced with a single step. \n— Lao-Tzu, Tao Te Ching, chapter 64 (6th century BCE), translated by James Legge (1891) \nAnd I would walk five hundred miles, And I would walk five hundred more, Just to be the man who walks a thousand miles To fall down at your door. \n— The Proclaimers, “I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)”, Sunshine on Leith (2001) \nAlmost there. . .

The shortest path tree specifies two pieces of information for each node $nu$ in the graph: \n• $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is the length of the shortest path from s to $nu$ ;   \n• pred $( nu )$ is the second-to-last vertex in the shortest path from s to $nu$ . \nIn this chapter, we consider the more general all pairs shortest path problem, which asks for the shortest path from every possible source to every possible destination. For every pair of vertices $u$ and $nu$ , we want to compute the following information: \n• $scriptstyle d i s t ( u , nu )$ is the length of the shortest path from $u$ to $nu$ ;   \n• pred $[ ( u , nu )$ is the second-to-last vertex on the shortest path from $u$ to $nu$ .",

Almost there. . . \n— Red Leader [Drewe Henley], Star Wars (1977) \nAll-Pairs Shortest Paths \n9.1 Introduction \nIn the previous chapter, we discussed several algorithms to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex s to every other vertex of the graph, by constructing a shortest path tree rooted at $s$ . The shortest path tree specifies two pieces of information for each node $nu$ in the graph: \n• $operatorname { d i s t } ( nu )$ is the length of the shortest path from s to $nu$ ;   \n• pred $( nu )$ is the second-to-last vertex in the shortest path from s to $nu$ . \nIn this chapter, we consider the more general all pairs shortest path problem, which asks for the shortest path from every possible source to every possible destination. For every pair of vertices $u$ and $nu$ , we want to compute the following information: \n• $scriptstyle d i s t ( u , nu )$ is the length of the shortest path from $u$ to $nu$ ;   \n• pred $[ ( u , nu )$ is the second-to-last vertex on the shortest path from $u$ to $nu$ . \nThese intuitive definitions exclude a few boundary cases, all of which we already saw in the previous chapter. \n• If there is no path from $u$ to $nu$ , then there is no shortest path from $u$ to $nu$ ; in this case, we define $d i s t ( u , nu ) = infty$ and $p r e d ( u , nu ) = tt N u c L$ .   \n• If there is a negative cycle between $u$ and $nu$ , then there are paths1 from $u$ to $nu$ with arbitrarily negative length; in this case, we define $d i s t ( u , nu ) = - infty$ and $p r e d ( u , nu ) = tt N u c L$ .   \n• Finally, if $u$ does not lie on a negative cycle, then the shortest path from $u$ to itself has no edges, and therefore doesn’t have a last edge; in this case, we define $d i s t ( u , u ) = 0$ and pred $( u , u ) = mathrm { N u L L }$ . \nThe desired output of the all-pairs shortest path problem is a pair of $V times V$ arrays, one storing all $V ^ { 2 }$ shortest-path distances,2 the other storing all $V ^ { 2 }$ predecessors. In this chapter, I’ll focus almost exclusively on computing the distance array. The predecessor array, from which we can compute the actual shortest paths, can be computed with only minor modifications (hint, hint). \n9.2 Lots of Single Sources \nThe most obvious solution to the all-pairs shortest path problem is to run a single-source shortest path algorithm $V$ times, once for each possible source vertex. Specifically, to fill the one-dimensional subarray $d i s t [ s , cdot ] .$ , we invoke a single-source algorithm starting at the source vertex s. \nThe running time of this algorithm obviously depends on which single-source shortest path algorithm we use. Just as in the single-source setting, there are four natural options, depending on the structure of the graph and its edge weights: \n• If the edges of the graph are unweighted, breadth-first search gives us an overall running time of $O ( V E ) = O ( V ^ { 3 } )$ .   \n• If the graph is acyclic, scanning the vertices in topological order also gives us an overall running time of $O ( V E ) = O ( V ^ { 3 } )$ .   \n• If all edge weights are non-negative, Dijkstra’s algorithm gives us a running time to $O ( V E log V ) = O ( V ^ { 3 } log V )$ .3   \n• Finally, in the most general setting, the Bellman-Ford algorithm gives us an overall running time of $O ( V ^ { 2 } E ) = O ( V ^ { 4 } )$ .",

This addition doesn’t change the shortest paths between any pair of original vertices, because there are no paths into s. \nComplete pseudocode for Johnson’s algorithm is shown in Figure 9.2. The running time of this algorithm is dominated by the calls to Dijkstra’s algorithm. Specifically, we spend $O ( V E )$ time running BellmanFord once, $O ( V E log V )$ time running Dijkstra $V$ times, and $O ( V + E )$ time doing other bookkeeping. Thus, the overall running time is $O ( V E log V ) = O ( V ^ { 3 } log V )$ .4 Negative edges don’t slow us down after all!",

The modified algorithm is shown below. \nGiven how we derived it, it should come as no surprise that the resulting algorithm is exactly the same as interleaving $V$ different executions of BellmanFord, each with a different source vertex.

Bellman’s recurrence breaks the shortest path into a slightly shorter path and a single edge, by considering all possible predecessors of the target vertex. Instead, let’s break the shortest paths into two shorter shortest paths at the middle vertex. This idea gives us a different recurrence for the same function $d i s t ( u , nu , ell )$ . Here we need to stop at the base case $ell = 1$ instead of $ell = 0$ , because a path with at most one edge has no “middle” vertex. To simplify the recurrence slightly, let’s define $w ( nu to nu ) = 0$ for every vertex $nu$ . \nAs stated, this recurrence only works when $ell$ is a power of 2, since otherwise we might try to find the shortest path with (at most) a fractional number of edges! But that’s not really a problem; $d i s t ( u , nu , ell )$ is the true shortest-path distance from $u$ to $nu$ for all $ell geq V - 1$ ; in particular, we can use $ell = 2 ^ { lceil log V rceil } < 2 V$ . \nOnce again, a dynamic programming solution is straightforward. Even before we write down the algorithm, we can tell the running time is $O ( V ^ { 3 } log V )$ —we need to consider $V$ possible values of $u , nu$ , and $x$ , but only $lceil lg V rceil$ possible values of $ell$ .

For this reason, the shortest path inner loop is sometimes referred to as “min-plus” or “distance” or “funny” matrix multiplication. \nOur slower algorithm ShimbelAPSP is the standard iterative algorithm for computing the $( V - 1 ) mathrm { t h }$ “min-plus power” of the weight matrix $w$ . The first set of loops sets up the min-plus identity matrix, with 0s on the main diagonal and $infty$ everywhere else, and each iteration of the second main loop computes the next “min-plus power”. FischerMeyerAPSP replaces this iterative method for computing powers with repeated squaring, exactly as we saw at the end of Chapter 1. Once again, we see the influence of ancient Egyptian ἀρπεδονάπται! \nThere are faster divide-and-conquer algorithms for (standard) matrix multiplication, similar to Karatsuba’s divide-and-conquer algorithm for multiplying integers. The first such algorithm, described by Volker Strassen in 1969, reduces the problem of multiplying two $n times n$ matrices to seven instances of multiplying two $n / 2 times n / 2$ matrices; Strassen’s algorithm runs in $O ( n ^ { log 7 } ) = O ( n ^ { 2 . 8 0 7 3 5 5 } )$ . Strassen’s algorithm has been improved many times over the last fifty years; as of 2018, the fastest matrix-multiplication algorithm known runs in $O ( n ^ { 2 . 3 7 2 8 6 4 } )$ time.6 Unfortunately, all of these faster algorithms use subtraction, and there’s no “funny” equivalent of subtraction. (What’s the inverse operation for min?) So at least for general graphs, there’s no obvious way to speed up the inner loop of our dynamic programming algorithms. \nBut “not obvious” does not mean “impossible”! In fact, there are several significantly faster algorithms for special cases of the all-pairs shortest paths problem. One of the nicest is a simple randomized algorithm discovered in 1991 by Zvi Galil and Oded Margalit, and further simplified in 1992 by Raimund Seidel, that computes all-pairs shortest path distances in unweighted, undirected graphs in $O ( M ( V ) log V )$ expected time, where $M ( n ) = O ( n ^ { 2 . 3 7 2 8 6 4 } )$ is the time required to (seriously) multiply two $n times n$ integer matrices.7 Galil, Margalit, and Seidel’s approach has since been extended to compute actual shortest paths, deterministically, in directed graphs, with small integer edge weights, in strongly subcubic time. \nOn the other hand, despite considerable progress in the small-integer-weight setting, nobody knows how to compute all-pairs shortest paths for more general edge weights in $O ( V ^ { 2 . 9 9 9 9 9 9 } )$ time, for any number of 9s. Moreover, there is some evidence that such an algorithm is impossible! So maybe “not obvious” does mean “impossible” after all. \n9.8 (Kleene-Roy-)Floyd-Warshall(-Ingerman) \nOur fast dynamic programming algorithm is still a factor of $O ( log V )$ slower in the worst case than the standard implementation of Johnson’s algorithm. A different formulation of shortest paths that removes this logarithmic factor was proposed twice in 1962, first by Robert Floyd and later independently by Peter Ingerman, both slightly generalizing an algorithm of Stephen Warshall published earlier in the same year. In fact, Warshall’s algorithm was previously discovered by Bernard Roy in 1959, and the underlying recursion pattern was used by Stephen Kleene8 in 1951. \nWarshall’s (and Roy’s and Kleene’s) insight was to use a different third parameter in the dynamic programming recurrence. Instead of considering paths with a limited number of edges, they considered paths that can pass through only certain vertices. Here, “pass through” means “both enter and leave”; for example, the path $w {  } x {  } y {  } z$ starts at $w$ , passes through $x$ and $y$ , and ends at $z$ . \nNumber the vertices arbitrarily from 1 to $V$ . For every pair of vertices $u$ and $nu$ and every integer $r$ , we define a path $pi ( u , nu , r )$ as follows: \n$pi ( u , nu , r )$ is the shortest path (if any) from $u$ to $nu$ that passes through only vertices numbered at most $r$ . \nIn particular, $pi ( u , nu , V )$ is the true shortest path from $u$ to $nu$ .

The recursive structure of $pi ( u , nu , r )$ immediately implies the following recurrence: \nOur goal is to compute $d i s t ( u , nu , V )$ for all vertices $u$ and $nu$ . Once again, this recurrence can be evaluated by a straightforward dynamic programming algorithm in $O ( V ^ { 3 } )$ time. \nLike all our previous dynamic programming algorithms for shortest paths, we can simplify KleeneAPSP by removing the third dimension of the memoization table. Also, because we chose the vertex numbering arbitrarily, there’s no reason to refer to it explicitly in the pseudocode. We finally arrive at Floyd’s improvement of Warshall’s algorithm: \nIt’s interesting to compare FloydWarshall with our earlier, slightly slower dynamic programming algorithm LeyzorekAPSP. Instead of $O ( log V )$ passes through all triples of vertices, FloydWarshall requires only a single pass, but only because it uses a different nesting order for the three loops! \n\nExercises \n1.

The arbitrage business is a money-making scheme that takes advantage of differences in currency exchange. In particular, suppose 1 US dollar buys 120 Japanese yen, 1 yen buys 0.01 euros, and 1 euro buys 1.2 US dollars. Then, a trader starting with $$ 1$ can convert their money from dollars to yen, then from yen to euros, and finally from euros back to dollars, ending with $$ 1.44$ ! The cycle of currencies $$ 123,456,78$ is called an arbitrage cycle. Of course, finding and exploiting arbitrage cycles before the prices are corrected requires extremely fast algorithms. \nSuppose $n$ different currencies are traded in your currency market. You are given the matrix $E x c h [ 1 ldots n , 1 ldots n ]$ of exchange rates between every pair of currencies; for each $i$ and $j$ , one unit of currency $i$ can be traded for $E x c h [ i , j ]$ units of currency $j$ .

Morty needs to retrieve a stabilized plumbus from the Clackspire Labyrinth. He must enter the labyrinth using Rick’s interdimensional portal gun, traverse the Labyrinth to a plumbus, then take that plumbus through the Labyrinth to a fleeb to be stabilized, and finally take the stabilized plumbus back to the original portal to return home. Plumbuses are stabilized by fleeb juice, which any fleeb will release immediately after being removed from its fleebhole. An unstabilized plumbus will explode if it is carried more than 137 flinks from its original storage unit. The Clackspire Labyrinth smells like farts, so Morty wants to spend as little time there as possible. \nRick has given Morty a detailed map of the Clackspire Labyrinth, which consist of a directed graph $G = ( V , E )$ with non-negative edge weights (indicating distance in flinks), along with two disjoint subsets $P subset V$ and $F subset V$ , indicating the plumbus storage units and fleebholes, respectively. Morty needs to identify a start vertex s, a plumbus storage unit $p in P$ , and a fleebhole $f in F$ , such that the shortest-path distance from $p$ to $f$ is at most 137 flinks long, and the length of the shortest walk $s  p  f  s$ is as short as possible. \nDescribe and analyze an algo(burp)rithm to so(burp)olve Morty’s problem.

Let $G = ( V , E )$ be a directed graph with weighted edges; edge weights could be positive, negative, or zero. \n(a) How would we delete an arbitrary vertex $nu$ from this graph, without changing the shortest-path distance between any other pair of vertices? Describe an algorithm that constructs a directed graph $G ^ { prime } = left( V setminus { nu } , E ^ { prime } right)$ with weighted edges, such that the shortest-path distance between any two vertices in $G ^ { prime }$ is equal to the shortest-path distance between the same two vertices in $G$ , in $O ( V ^ { 2 } )$ time.   \n(b) Now suppose we have already computed all shortest-path distances in $G ^ { prime }$ . Describe an algorithm to compute the shortest-path distances in the original graph $G$ from $nu$ to every other vertex, and from every other vertex to $nu$ , all in $O ( V ^ { 2 } )$ time. \n(c) Combine parts (a) and (b) into another all-pairs shortest path algorithm that runs in $O ( V ^ { 3 } )$ time. (The resulting algorithm is almost the same as Floyd-Warshall!) \n9. Suppose $A$ and $B$ are boolean $n times n$ matrices.

Assume that we have a subroutine MatrixMultiply that computes the standard product of two $n times n$ matrices in $O ( n ^ { omega } )$ time, for some unknown constant $omega geq 2$ . \n(a) Let $G ^ { 2 }$ denote the graph with the same vertices as $G$ , where two vertices are connected by a edge if and only if they are connected by a path of length at most 2 in $G$ . Describe an algorithm to compute the adjacency matrix of $G ^ { 2 }$ using a single call to MatrixMultiply and $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ additional time.   \n(b) Suppose we discover that $G ^ { 2 }$ is a complete graph. Describe an algorithm to compute the matrix $D$ of shortest path distances in $G$ in $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ additional time.   \n(c) Suppose we recursively compute the matrix $D ^ { 2 }$ of shortest-path distances in $G ^ { 2 }$ .

Gideon Yuval proposed the following reduction from min-plus matrix multiplication to standard matrix multiplication in 1976. Suppose we are given two integers $n times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ of integers, each of whose entries is between 0 and $M$ , and we want to compute their min-plus product matrix $C$ , defined by setting \nfor all indices $i$ and $k$ .

How many arithmetic operations does Yuval’s algorithm need to compute the min-plus product C?   \n(d) Given a single $n times n$ integer matrix $A _ { i }$ how many arithmetic operations are required to compute the nth “funny” power of A using Yuval’s algorithm? (Recall that if $A$ is the weighted adjacency matrix of a graph, then the nth “funny” power of $A$ is the matrix of shortest-path distances.)   \n(e) Why doesn’t Yuval’s algorithm imply an all-pairs shortest path algorithm that is faster than Floyd-Warshall for arbitrary edge weights? How are we cheating? \nA process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it. \n— The First Law of Mentat, in Frank Herbert’s Dune (1965) \nContrary to expectation, flow usually happens not during relaxing moments of leisure and entertainment, but rather when we are actively involved in a difficult enterprise, in a task that stretches our mental and physical abilities... .

S. Air Force researcher Theodore E. Harris and retired U. S. Army general Frank S. Ross wrote a classified report studying the rail network that linked the Soviet Union to its satellite countries in Eastern Europe. The network was modeled as a graph with 44 vertices, representing geographic regions, and 105 edges, representing links between those regions in the rail network. Each edge was given a weight, representing the rate at which material could be shipped from one region to the next. Essentially by trial and error, they determined both the maximum amount of stuff that could be moved from Russia into Europe, as well as the cheapest way to disrupt the network by removing links (or in less abstract terms, blowing up train tracks), which they called “the bottleneck”. Their report, which included the drawing of the network in Figure 10.1, was only declassified in 1999.1",

For both problems, the input is a directed graph $G = left( V , E right)$ with two special vertices s and $t$ , called the source and target. As in previous chapters, I will write $mathbf { Delta } u to nu$ to denote the directed edge from vertex $u$ to vertex $nu$ . Intuitively, the maxim\u0001um flow problem asks for the maximum rate at which some resource can be moved from $s$ to $t$ ; the minimum cut problem asks for the minimum damage needed to separate $s$ from $t$ . \n10.1 Flows \nAn $( s , t )$ -flow (or just a flow if the source and target vertices are clear from context) is a function $f : E to mathbb { R }$ that satisfies the following conservation constraint at every vertex $nu$ except possibly $s$ and $t$ : \nIn English, the total flow into $nu$ is equal to the total flow out of $nu$ . To keep the notation simple, we define $f ( u to nu ) = 0$ if there is no edge $u {  } nu$ in the graph. \nThe value of the flow $f$ , denot\u0001ed $| f |$ , is the total net flow o\u0001ut of the source vertex s: \nIt’s not hard to prove that $| f |$ is also equal to the total net flow into the target vertex $t$ , as follows. To simplify notation, let $partial f ( nu )$ denote the total net flow out of any vertex $nu$ : \nThe conservation constraint implies that $partial f ( nu ) = 0$ or every vertex $nu$ except s and $t$ , so \nOn the other hand, any flow that leaves one vertex must enter another vertex, so we must have $begin{array} { r } { sum _ { nu } partial f ( nu ) = 0 } end{array}$ . It follows immediately that $| f | = partial f ( s ) = - partial f ( t )$ . \nNow suppose we have another function $c colon E to mathbb { R } _ { geq 0 }$ that assigns a nonnegative capacity $c ( e )$ to each edge e. We say that a flow $f$ is feasible (with respect to $c$ ) if $0 leq f ( e ) leq c ( e )$ for every edge e. Most of the time we consider only flows that are feasible with respect to some fixed capacity function c. We say that a flow $f$ saturates edge $e$ if $f ( e ) = c ( e )$ , and avoids edge e if $f ( e ) = 0$ . The maximum flow problem is to compute a feasible $( s , t )$ -flow in a given directed graph, with a given capacity function, whose value is as large as possible. \n10.2 Cuts \nAn $( s , t )$ -cut (or just cut if the source and target vertices are clear from context) is a partition of the vertices into disjoint subsets $s$ and $T$ —meaning $S cup T = V$ and $S cap T = emptyset$ —where $s in S$ and $t in T$ . \nIf we have a capacity function $c : E to mathbb { R } _ { geq 0 }$ , the capacity of a cut is the sum of the capacities of the edges that start in $s$ and end in $T$ : \n(Again, if $nu {  } w$ is not an edge in the graph, we assume $c ( nu  w ) = 0 .$ ) Notice that the definitio\u0001n is asymmetric; edges that start in $T$ and end\u0001in $s$ are unimportant.",

The maximum flow problem is to compute a feasible $( s , t )$ -flow in a given directed graph, with a given capacity function, whose value is as large as possible. \n10.2 Cuts \nAn $( s , t )$ -cut (or just cut if the source and target vertices are clear from context) is a partition of the vertices into disjoint subsets $s$ and $T$ —meaning $S cup T = V$ and $S cap T = emptyset$ —where $s in S$ and $t in T$ . \nIf we have a capacity function $c : E to mathbb { R } _ { geq 0 }$ , the capacity of a cut is the sum of the capacities of the edges that start in $s$ and end in $T$ : \n(Again, if $nu {  } w$ is not an edge in the graph, we assume $c ( nu  w ) = 0 .$ ) Notice that the definitio\u0001n is asymmetric; edges that start in $T$ and end\u0001in $s$ are unimportant. \nThe minimum cut problem is to compute an $( s , t )$ -cut whose capacity is as small as possible. \nIntuitively, the minimum cut is the cheapest way to disrupt all flow from s to t. Indeed, it is not hard to show the following relationship between flows and cuts: \nLemma 10.1. Let $f$ be any feasible $( s , t )$ -flow, and let $( S , T )$ be any $( s , t )$ -cut. The value of $f$ is at most the capacity $o f ( S , T )$ . Moreover, $| f | = | S , T |$ if and only if $f$ saturates every edge from $s$ to $T$ and avoids every edge from $T$ to $s$ . \nProof: Choose your favorite flow $f$ and your favorite cut $( S , T )$ , and then follow the bouncing inequalities: \nIn the second step, we are just adding zeros, because $partial f ( nu ) = 0$ for every vertex $nu in S setminus { s }$ . In the fourth step, we are removing flow values $f ( x {  } y )$ where \nboth $x$ and $y$ are in $s$ , because they appear in both sums: positively when $nu = x$ and $w = y$ , and negatively when $nu = y$ and $u = x$ . \nThe first inequalities in this derivation is actually an equality if and only if $f$ avoids every edge from $T$ to $s$ . Similarly, the second inequality is actually an equality if and only if $f$ saturates every edge from $s$ to $T$ . □ \nThis lemma immediately implies that if $| f | = | S , T |$ , then $f$ must be a maximum flow, and $( S , T )$ must be a minimum cut. \n10.3 The Maxflow-Mincut Theorem \nSurprisingly, in every flow network, there is a feasible $( s , t )$ -flow $f$ and an $( s , t )$ - cut $( S , T )$ such that $| f | = lvert | S , T rvert |$ . This is the famous Maxflow-Mincut Theorem, first proved by Lester Ford (of shortest-path fame) and Delbert Fulkerson in 1954 and independently by Peter Elias, Amiel Feinstein, and Claude Shannon (of information-theory and maze-solving-robot fame) in 1956. \nThe Maxflow-Mincut Theorem. In every flow network with source s and target $t$ , the value of the maximum $( s , t )$ -flow is equal to the capacity of the minimum $( s , t )$ -cut. \nFord and Fulkerson proved this theorem as follows. Fix a graph $G$ , vertices s and $t$ , and a capacity function $c : E to mathbb { R } _ { geq 0 }$ . The proof will be easier if we assume that $G$ is reduced, meaning there is at most one edge between any two vertices $u$ and $nu$ . In particular, either $c ( u {  } nu ) = 0$ or $c ( nu {  } u ) = 0$ . This assumption is easy to enforce: Subdivide each edg\u0001e $u {  } nu$ in $G$ wit\u0001h a new vertex $x$ , replacing $u {  } nu$ with a path $u {  } x {  } nu$ , and define $c ( u {  } x ) = c ( x {  } nu ) = c ( u {  } nu )$ . The modifi\u0001ed graph has the\u0001sam\u0001e maximum flow v\u0001alue and \u0001minimum c\u0001ut capacity as the original graph. \nLet $f$ be an arbitrary feasible $( s , t )$ -flow in $G$ . We define a new capacity function $c _ { f } : V times V to mathbb { R } .$ called the residual capacity, as follows:",

This is the famous Maxflow-Mincut Theorem, first proved by Lester Ford (of shortest-path fame) and Delbert Fulkerson in 1954 and independently by Peter Elias, Amiel Feinstein, and Claude Shannon (of information-theory and maze-solving-robot fame) in 1956. \nThe Maxflow-Mincut Theorem. In every flow network with source s and target $t$ , the value of the maximum $( s , t )$ -flow is equal to the capacity of the minimum $( s , t )$ -cut. \nFord and Fulkerson proved this theorem as follows. Fix a graph $G$ , vertices s and $t$ , and a capacity function $c : E to mathbb { R } _ { geq 0 }$ . The proof will be easier if we assume that $G$ is reduced, meaning there is at most one edge between any two vertices $u$ and $nu$ . In particular, either $c ( u {  } nu ) = 0$ or $c ( nu {  } u ) = 0$ . This assumption is easy to enforce: Subdivide each edg\u0001e $u {  } nu$ in $G$ wit\u0001h a new vertex $x$ , replacing $u {  } nu$ with a path $u {  } x {  } nu$ , and define $c ( u {  } x ) = c ( x {  } nu ) = c ( u {  } nu )$ . The modifi\u0001ed graph has the\u0001sam\u0001e maximum flow v\u0001alue and \u0001minimum c\u0001ut capacity as the original graph. \nLet $f$ be an arbitrary feasible $( s , t )$ -flow in $G$ . We define a new capacity function $c _ { f } : V times V to mathbb { R } .$ called the residual capacity, as follows: \nIntuitively, the residual capacity of an edge indicates how much more flow can be pushed through that edge. Because $f geq 0$ and $f leq c$ , these residual capacities are always non-negative. It is possible to have $c _ { f } ( u to nu ) > 0$ even if $u {  } nu$ is not an edge in the original graph $G$ . Thus, we define the\u0001residual graph $G _ { f } = left( V , E _ { f } right)$ , where $E _ { f }$ is the set of edges whose residual capacity is positive. Most residual graphs are not reduced; in particular, if $0 < f ( u to nu ) < c ( u to nu )$ , then the residual graph $G _ { f }$ contains both $u {  } nu$ and its reversal $nu {  } u$ . \nNow we have two cases to consider: Either there is a directed path from the source vertex $s$ to the target vertex $t$ in the residual graph $G ^ { f }$ , or there isn’t. \nFirst suppose the residual graph $G _ { f }$ contains a directed path $P$ from $s$ to $t$ ; we call $P$ an augmenting path. Let $F = mathrm { m i n } _ { u  nu in P } c _ { f } ( u  nu )$ denote the maximum amount of flow that we can push through $P$ . We defi\u0001ne a new flow $f ^ { prime } colon E to mathbb { R }$ (in the original graph) as follows: \nI claim that this new flow $f ^ { prime }$ is feasible with respect to the original capacities $c$ , meaning $f ^ { prime } geq 0$ and $f ^ { prime } leq c$ everywhere. Consider an edge $u {  } nu$ in the original graph $G$ . There are three cases to consider. \n• If the augmenting path $P$ contains $u {  } nu$ , then \nbecause $f$ is feasible, and \n• If the augmenting path $P$ contains the reversed edge $nu {  } u$ , then \nagain because $f$ is feasible, and \n• Finally, if neither $u {  } nu$ nor $nu {  } u$ is in the augmenting path, then $f ^ { prime } ( u {  } nu ) =$ $f ( u { to } nu )$ , and theref\u0001ore $0 leq f ^ { prime } ( u  nu ) leq c ( u  nu )$ , because $f$ is feasible. \nSo $f$ is i\u0001ndeed feasible. \nFinally, only the first edge in the augmenting path leaves $s$ , which implies $| f ^ { prime } | = | f | + F > | f |$ . Thus, $f ^ { prime }$ is a feasible flow with larger value than $f$ . We conclude that if there is a path from $s$ to $t$ in the residual graph $G _ { f }$ , then $f$ is not a maximum flow. \nOn the other hand, suppose the residual graph $G _ { f }$ does not contain a directed path from $s$ to $t$ . Let $s$ be the set of vertices that are reachable from s in $G _ { f }$ , and let $T = V setminus S$ . The partition $( S , T )$ is clearly an $( s , t )$ -cut. For every vertex $u in S$ and $nu in T$ , we have \nThe feasibility of $f$ implies $c ( u to nu ) - f ( u to nu ) geq 0$ and $f ( nu to u ) geq 0$ , so in fact we must have $c ( u to nu ) - f ( u to nu ) = 0$ and $f ( nu to u ) = 0$ . In oth\u0001er words, our flow $f$ saturates every\u0001edge from\u0001 $s$ to $T$ and avoi\u0001ds every edge from $T$ to $s$ . Lemma 10.1 now implies that $| f | = | S , T |$ , which means $f$ is a maximum flow and $( S , T )$ is a minimum cut. \nThis completes the proof! \n10.4 Ford and Fulkerson’s augmenting-path algorithm \nFord and Fulkerson’s proof of the Maxflow-Mincut Theorem immediately suggests an algorithm to compute maximum flows: Starting with the zero flow, repeatedly augment the flow along any path from $s$ to $t$ in the residual graph, until there is no such path. \nThis algorithm has an important but straightforward corollary: \nIntegrality Theorem. If all capacities in a flow network are integers, then there is a maximum flow such that the flow through every edge is an integer. \nProof: We argue by induction that after each iteration of the augmenting path algorithm, all flow values and all residual capacities are integers. \n• Before the first iteration, all flow values are 0 (which is an integer), and all residual capacities are the original capacities, which are integers by definition. • In each later iteration, the induction hypothesis implies that the capacity $F$ of the augmenting path is an integer, so augmenting changes the flow on each edge, and therefore the residual capacity of each edge, by an integer. \nIn particular, each iteration of the augmenting path algorithm increases the value of the flow by a positive integer. It follows that the algorithm eventually halts and returns a maximum flow. □ \nIf every edge capacity is an integer, then conservatively, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm halts after at most $| f ^ { * } |$ iterations, where $f ^ { * }$ is the actual maximum flow. In each iteration, we can build the residual graph $G _ { f }$ and perform a whatever-first-search to find an augmenting path in $O ( E )$ time. Thus, in this setting, the algorithm runs in $O ( E | f ^ { * } | )$ time in the worst case. \nJack Edmonds and Richard Karp observed that this running time analysis is essentially tight. Consider the 4-node network in Figure 10.7, where $X$ is some large integer. The maximum flow in this network is clearly 2X . However, Ford-Fulkerson might alternate between pushing one unit of flow along the augmenting path $s {  } u {  } nu {  } t$ and then pushing one unit of flow along the augmenting path $s {  } nu {  } u {  } t$ , leading to a running time of $Theta ( X ) = Omega ( | f ^ { * } | )$ .",

        "content": "Ford and Fulkerson’s algorithm is usually fast in practice, and it is always fast when the maximum flow value $| f ^ { * } |$ is small, but without further constraints on the augmenting paths, this is not an efficient algorithm in worst case. Edmonds and Karp’s bad example network can be described using only $O ( log X )$ bits; thus, the running time of Ford-Fulkerson is actually exponential in the input size. \nnIrrational Capacities \nBut what if the capacities are not integers? If we multiply all the capacities by the same (positive) constant, the maximum flow increases everywhere by the same constant factor. It follows that if all the edge capacities are rational, then the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm eventually halts, although still in exponential time (in the number of bits used to described the input). \nHowever, if we allow irrational capacities, the algorithm can actually loop forever, always finding smaller and smaller augmenting paths. Worse yet, this infinite sequence of augmentations may not even converge to the maximum flow, or even to a significant fraction of the maximum flow! The smallest network that exhibits this bad behavior was discovered by Uri Zwick in 1993.2 \nConsider the six-node network shown in Figure 10.8. Six of the nine edges have some large integer capacity $X$ , two have capacity 1, and one has capacity $phi = ( sqrt { 5 } - 1 ) / 2 approx 0 . 6 1 8 0 3 4$ , chosen so that $1 - phi = phi ^ { 2 }$ . To prove that the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm can get stuck, we can watch the residual capacities of the three horizontal edges as the algorithm progresses. (The residual capacities of the other six edges will always be at least $X - 3 .$ ) \nSuppose the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm starts by choosing the central augmenting path, shown at the top of Figure 10.8. The three horizontal edges, in order from left to right, now have residual capacities 1, 0, and $phi$ .

However, flows have a second characterization that is more natural and useful in certain contexts. \nConsider an arbitrary graph $G$ with source vertex s and target vertex t. Fix any two $( s , t )$ -flows $f$ and $g$ and any two real numbers $alpha$ and $beta$ , and consider the function $h colon E to mathbb { R }$ defined by setting \nfor every edge $u {  } nu$ ; we can write this definition more simply as $h = alpha f + beta g$ . Straightforward d\u0001efinition-chasing implies that $h$ is also an $( s , t )$ -flow with value $| h | = alpha | f | + beta | g |$ . More generally, any linear combination of $( s , t )$ -flows is also an $( s , t )$ -flow. \nIt turns out that any $( s , t )$ -flow can be written as a weighted sum of flows with a special structure. For any directed path $P$ from $s$ to $t$ , we define a corresponding path flow as follows: \nStraightforward definition-chasing implies that the function $P colon E to mathbb { R }$ is indeed an $( s , t )$ -flow with value 1. I am deliberately overloading the variable $P$ to mean both the path (a sequence of vertices and directed edges) and the unit flow along that path. \nSimilarly, for any directed cycle $C$ , we define a corresponding cycle flow by setting \nAgain, it is easy to verify that $C : E to mathbb { R }$ is an $( s , t )$ -flow with value zero. \nOur earlier argument implies that any linear combination of path flows and cycle flows is another flow; this weighted sum is called a flow decomposition. Moreover, every non-negative flow has a flow decomposition with the following special structure. \nFlow Decomposition Theorem. Every non-negative $( s , t )$ -flow $f$ can be written as a positive linear combination of directed $( s , t )$ -paths and directed cycles. Moreover, a directed edge $u {  } nu$ appears in at least one of these paths or cycles if and only if $f ( u to nu ) > 0$ , an\u0001d the total number of paths and cycles is at most the number of edg\u0001es in the network. \nProof: We prove the theorem by induction on the number of edges carrying non-zero flow, intuitively by running the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm backward. As long as at least one edge in the graph carries positive flow, we can find either an $( s , t )$ -path or a directed cycle that carries flow. Subtracting as much flow as possible from that path or cycle empties at least one edge, so the Recursion Fairy can give us the rest of the decomposition. \nTo formalize this argument, we first consider the special case of circulations; these are flows with value 0, where flow is conserved at every vertex. Fix an arbitrary circulation $f$ in an arbitrary flow network, and let # $f$ denote the number of edges $u {  } nu$ such that $f ( u {  } nu ) > 0$ . We prove that $f$ can be decomposed into a positive linea\u0001r combination of\u0001at most ma $mathbf { x } { 0 , # f - 1 }$ cycles, by induction on $# f$ . There are three cases to consider: \n\n• If # $boldsymbol { mathscr { f } } = 0$ , then $f$ is vacuously a linear combination of zero cycles. • Suppose $f ( u {  } nu ) > 0$ for a single directed cycle of edges $u {  } nu$ . Then # $f geq 2$ , and $f$ is trivi\u0001ally a linear combination of one cycle. • Otherwise, pick an arbitrary edge $u {  } nu$ with $f ( u {  } nu ) > 0$ . Consider an arbitrary walk $nu _ { 0 } {  } nu _ { 1 } {  } nu _ { 2 } {  } cdots$ with $nu _ { 0 } = u$ and $nu _ { 1 } = nu$ \u0001, such that $f ( nu _ { i - 1 } {  } nu _ { i } ) > 0$ for every inde\u0001x $i$ .\u0001The\u0001conservation constraint implies that every ver\u0001tex with incoming flow also has outgoing flow, so we can make this walk arbitrarily long; in particular, the walk must eventually visit some vertex more than once. Let $k$ be the smallest index such that $nu _ { j } = nu _ { k }$ for some index $j < k$ . The subwalk $nu _ { j } {  } nu _ { j { - } 1 } {  } cdots {  } nu _ { k }$ is a simple directed cycle $C$ . \nDefine $F : = operatorname* { m i n } _ { e in C } f ( e ) $ , and consider the function $f ^ { prime } : = f - F cdot C$ , or more verbosely, \nStraightforward definition-chasing shows that $f ^ { prime }$ is another feasible circulation in $G$ . There is at least one edge $e in C$ such that $f ( e ) = F$ , and therefore $f ^ { prime } ( e ) = 0 .$ , which implies # $acute { z } f ^ { prime } leq # f - 1$ . Since fewer edges carry flow in $f ^ { prime }$ than in $f$ , the Recursion Fairy can decompose $f ^ { prime }$ into at most $# f ^ { prime } - 1 leq # f - 2$ cycles. Adding $F$ units of flow around cycle $C$ gives us a flow decomposition for $f$ ; more succinctly: $f = f ^ { prime } + F cdot C$ . \nNow let $f$ be an arbitrary $( s , t )$ -flow in an arbitrary flow network, such that $vert f vert > 0$ . Add an edge $t {  } s$ to the network, and define a circulation $f ^ { prime }$ by setting $f ^ { prime } ( t to s ) = | f |$ and $f ^ { prime } ( u {  } nu ) = f ( u {  } nu )$ for every original edge $u {  } nu$ ; observe that $# f ^ { prime } = # f + 1 geq 2$ . The\u0001previous a\u0001rgument implies that the cir\u0001culation $f ^ { prime }$ is a positive linear combination of at most $# f ^ { prime } - 1$ directed cycles. Deleting the edge $t {  } s$ gives us a decomposition of the original flow $f$ into at most # $f ^ { prime } - 1 = # f$ pa\u0001ths and cycles. Specifically, cycles in $f ^ { prime }$ that include $t {  } s$ become $( s , t )$ -paths in $f$ , and cycles in $f ^ { prime }$ that do not include $t {  } s$ remain cyc\u0001les in $f$ . □ \nThe proof of the Flow Decomposition Theorem implies stronger results in two interesting special cases. \n• Any circulation can be decomposed into a weighted sum of cycles; no paths are necessary.   \n• Any acyclic $( s , t )$ -flow can be decomposed into a weighted sum of $( s , t )$ -paths; no cycles are necessary. \nMoreover, by canceling flow cycles until no more remain, we can transform any flow into an acyclic flow with the same value. In particular, every flow network supports a maximum $( s , t )$ -flow that is acyclic. \nThe proof also immediately translates directly into an algorithm, similar to Ford-Fulkerson, to decompose any $( s , t )$ -flow into paths and cycles. The algorithm repeatedly seeks either a directed $( s , t )$ -path or a directed cycle in the remaining flow, and then subtracts as much flow as possible along that path or cycle, until the flow is empty. We can find a flow path or cycle in $O ( V )$ time as follows: \n• If any edge leaving s has positive flow, follow an arbitrary walk from s in the flow graph until it either reaches $t$ (giving us a flow path) or reaches some vertex for the second time (giving us a flow cycle). • If no edge leaving s has positive flow, find any other vertex $nu$ with positive outflow, and follow an arbitrary walk from $nu$ in the flow graph until it reaches some vertex for the second time (giving us a flow cycle). \nIn both cases, the conservation constraint implies that this algorithm will never get stuck. Each iteration takes $O ( V )$ time and removes at least one edge from the flow graph; thus, the entire decomposition algorithm runs in $O ( V E )$ time. \nFlow decompositions provide a natural lower bound on the running time of any maximum-flow algorithm that builds the flow one path or cycle at a time. Every flow can be decomposed into at most $E$ paths and cycles, each of which uses at most $V$ edges, so the overall complexity of the flow decomposition is $O ( V E )$ . Moreover, it is easy to construct flows for which every flow decomposition has complexity $Omega ( V E )$ . Thus, any maximum-flow algorithm that explicitly constructs a flow one path or cycle at a time—in particular, any implementation of Ford and Fulkerson’s augmenting path algorithm—must take $Omega ( V E )$ time in the worst case. \n\n10.6 Edmonds and Karp’s Algorithms \nFord and Fulkerson’s algorithm does not specify which path in the residual graph to augment; the poor worst-case behavior of the algorithm can be blamed on poor choices for the augmenting path. In the early 1970s, Jack Edmonds and Richard Karp published two natural rules for choosing augmenting paths, both of which led to more efficient algorithms. \nFattest Augmenting Paths \nEdmonds and Karp’s first rule is essentially a greedy algorithm: \nChoose the augmenting path with largest bottleneck value. \nIt’s not hard to show that the maximum-bottleneck $( s , t )$ -path in a directed graph can be computed in $O ( E log V )$ time using a “best-first” traversal, similar to Jarník’s minimum-spanning-tree algorithm or Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm. The algorithm grows a directed tree $T$ , rooted at $s$ , one vertex at a time, by repeatedly adding the highest-capacity edge leaving $T$ to $T$ , until $T$ contains a path from s to $t$ . Alternately, one could emulate Kruskal’s algorithm—insert edges one at a time in decreasing capacity order until there is a path from s to $t$ —although this approach is less efficient, at least when the graph is directed. \nTo complete the running-time analysis of the flow algorithm, we need an upper bound on the number of iterations before the algorithm halts. In fact, for arbitrary real capacities, the algorithm may never halt; see Exercise 18.

        "content": "10.6 Edmonds and Karp’s Algorithms \nFord and Fulkerson’s algorithm does not specify which path in the residual graph to augment; the poor worst-case behavior of the algorithm can be blamed on poor choices for the augmenting path. In the early 1970s, Jack Edmonds and Richard Karp published two natural rules for choosing augmenting paths, both of which led to more efficient algorithms. \nFattest Augmenting Paths \nEdmonds and Karp’s first rule is essentially a greedy algorithm: \nChoose the augmenting path with largest bottleneck value. \nIt’s not hard to show that the maximum-bottleneck $( s , t )$ -path in a directed graph can be computed in $O ( E log V )$ time using a “best-first” traversal, similar to Jarník’s minimum-spanning-tree algorithm or Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm. The algorithm grows a directed tree $T$ , rooted at $s$ , one vertex at a time, by repeatedly adding the highest-capacity edge leaving $T$ to $T$ , until $T$ contains a path from s to $t$ . Alternately, one could emulate Kruskal’s algorithm—insert edges one at a time in decreasing capacity order until there is a path from s to $t$ —although this approach is less efficient, at least when the graph is directed. \nTo complete the running-time analysis of the flow algorithm, we need an upper bound on the number of iterations before the algorithm halts. In fact, for arbitrary real capacities, the algorithm may never halt; see Exercise 18. For integer capacities, however, we can bound the number of iterations as a function of the maximum flow value $| f ^ { * } | _ { * }$ , as follows. \nLet $f$ be any flow in $G$ , and let $f ^ { prime }$ be the maximum flow in the current residual graph $G _ { f }$ . (At the beginning of the algorithm, $G _ { f } = G$ and $f ^ { prime } = f ^ { * }$ .) We have already proved that $f ^ { prime }$ can be decomposed into at most $E$ paths and cycles. A simple averaging argument implies that at least one of the paths in this decomposition must carry at least $| f ^ { prime } | / E$ units of flow. It follows immediately that the fattest $( s , t )$ -path in $G _ { f }$ carries at least $| f ^ { prime } | / E$ units of flow. \nThus, augmenting $f$ along the maximum-bottleneck path in $G _ { f }$ multiplies the value of the remaining maximum flow in $G _ { f }$ by a factor of at most $1 - 1 / E$ . In other words, the residual maximum flow value decays exponentially with the number of iterations. After $E cdot ln lvert f ^ { * } rvert$ iterations, the maximum flow value in $G _ { f }$ is at most \n(That’s Euler’s constant $e$ , not the edge e. Sorry.) In particular, after $| E cdot ln | f ^ { * } |$ iterations, the residual maximum flow value is less than 1. If all capacities are integers, the residual maximum flow value is also an integer, so it must be 0; in other words, $f$ is a maximum flow! \nWe conclude that for graphs with integer capacities, the Edmonds-Karp “fattest path” algorithm runs in $O ( E ^ { 2 } log E log | f ^ { * } | )$ time. Unlike the worst-case running time of raw Ford-Fulkerson, this time bound is actually a polynomial function of the input size. \nJust like the original Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the \"fattest path\" algorithm can get stuck in an infinite loop in networks with arbitrary real capacities. However, our analysis implies that even if the algorithm never halts, it maintains a flow $f$ that approaches a maximum flow in the limit. \nShortest Augmenting Paths \nThe second Edmonds-Karp rule was actually proposed as a practical heuristic by Ford and Fulkerson in their original maximum-flow paper; a variant of this rule was independently proposed in 1970 by the Russian mathematician Yefim Dinitz.3 \nChoose the augmenting path with the smallest number of edges. \nThe shortest augmenting path can be found in $O ( E )$ time by running breadth-first search in the residual graph. Surprisingly, the resulting algorithm halts after a polynomial number of iterations, independent of the actual edge capacities! \nThe proof of this polynomial upper bound relies on two observations about the evolution of the residual graph. Let $f _ { i }$ be the current flow after $i$ augmentation steps, let $G _ { i }$ be the corresponding residual graph. In particular, $f _ { 0 }$ is zero everywhere and $G _ { 0 } = G$ . For each vertex $nu$ , let $imath e nu e l _ { i } ( nu )$ denote the unweighted shortest-path distance from s to $nu$ in $G _ { i }$ , or equivalently, the level of $nu$ in a breadth-first search tree of $G _ { i }$ rooted at $s$ . In particular, if there is no path from $s$ to $nu$ in $G _ { i }$ , then $l e nu e l _ { i } ( nu ) = infty$ (because $operatorname* { m i n } { varnothing } = infty Re$ ). \nOur first observation is that the level of a vertex can only increase over time. \nLemma 10.2. level $_ { mathrm { : } } ( nu ) geq l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( nu )$ for all vertices $nu$ and all integers $i > 0$ . \nProof: Fix an arbitrary positive integer $i > 0$ and an arbitrary vertex $nu$ . We prove the claim by induction on $l e nu e l _ { i } ( nu )$ (and not on the integer $i$ ). As an inductive hypothesis, assume for every vertex $u$ such that $l e nu e l _ { i } ( u ) < l e nu e l _ { i } ( nu )$ , that $l e nu e l _ { i } ( u ) geq l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( u )$ .

In particular, if there is no path from $s$ to $nu$ in $G _ { i }$ , then $l e nu e l _ { i } ( nu ) = infty$ (because $operatorname* { m i n } { varnothing } = infty Re$ ). \nOur first observation is that the level of a vertex can only increase over time. \nLemma 10.2. level $_ { mathrm { : } } ( nu ) geq l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( nu )$ for all vertices $nu$ and all integers $i > 0$ . \nProof: Fix an arbitrary positive integer $i > 0$ and an arbitrary vertex $nu$ . We prove the claim by induction on $l e nu e l _ { i } ( nu )$ (and not on the integer $i$ ). As an inductive hypothesis, assume for every vertex $u$ such that $l e nu e l _ { i } ( u ) < l e nu e l _ { i } ( nu )$ , that $l e nu e l _ { i } ( u ) geq l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( u )$ . There are three cases to consider. \n• If $nu = s$ , we immediately have $l e nu e l _ { i } ( s ) = l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( s ) = 0$ .   \n• If there is no path from s to $nu$ in $G _ { i }$ , then $l e nu e l _ { i } ( nu ) = infty geq l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( nu )$ .   \n• Otherwise, let $s {  } cdots {  } u {  } nu$ be any unweighted shortest path from $s$ to $nu$ in the graph $G _ { i }$ . Be\u0001cause\u0001thi\u0001s is a shortest path, we have $l e nu e l _ { i } ( nu ) = l e nu e l _ { i } ( u ) + 1$ , so the inductive hypothesis implies level ${ mathrm { Omega } } _ { : } ( u ) geq l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( u )$ . To complete the proof, we need to show that $l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( u ) ge l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( nu ) - 1$ . We have two subcases to consider. – If $u {  } nu$ is an edge in $G _ { i - 1 }$ , then $l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( nu ) leq l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( u ) + 1$ , because the level\u0001s are defined by breadth-first traversal. – On the other hand, if $u {  } nu$ is not an edge in $G _ { i - 1 }$ , then its reversal $nu {  } u$ must be an edge in t\u0001he ith augmenting path, which by definition is\u0001the shortest path from s to $t$ in $G _ { i - 1 }$ . It follows that $begin{array} { r } { l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( nu ) = } end{array}$ leve $l _ { i - 1 } ( u ) - 1 le l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( u ) + 1$ . \nIn both subcases, we conclude that leve $l _ { i } ( nu ) = l e nu e l _ { i } ( u ) + 1 geq l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( u ) + 1 geq$ $l e nu e l _ { i - 1 } ( nu )$ . □ \nWhenever we augment the flow, the bottleneck edge in the augmenting path disappears from the residual graph, and some edges in the reversal of the augmenting path may (re-)appear. Our second observation is that an edge cannot appear or disappear too many times. \nLemma 10.3. During the execution of the Edmonds-Karp shortest-augmentingpath algorithm, each edge $u {  } nu$ disappears from the residual graph $G _ { f }$ at most $V / 2$ times. \nProof: Suppose $u {  } nu$ is in two residual graphs $G _ { i }$ and $G _ { j + 1 }$ , but not in any of the intermediate re\u0001sidual graphs $G _ { i + 1 } , ldots , G _ { j }$ , for some $i < j$ . Then $u {  } nu$ must be in the ith augmenting path, so level $mathbf { Phi } _ { i } ( nu ) = l e nu e l _ { i } ( u ) + 1$ , and $nu {  } u$ \u0001must be on the $j mathrm { t h }$ augmenting path, so level ${ bf Phi } _ { j } ( nu ) = l e nu e l _ { j } ( u ) - 1$ . The previ\u0001ous lemma implies that \nIn other words, between the disappearance and reappearance of $u {  } nu$ , the distance from s to $u$ increased by at least 2. Because every level is eit\u0001her less than $V$ or infinite, the number of disappearances is at most $V / 2$ . □ \nNow we can derive an upper bound on the number of iterations. Because each edge disappears at most $V / 2$ times, there are at most $E V / 2$ edge disappearances overall. But at least one edge disappears on each iteration, so the algorithm must halt after at most $E V / 2$ iterations. Finally, each iteration requires $O ( E )$ time, so the overall algorithm runs in $O ( V E ^ { 2 } )$ time. \n10.7 Further Progress \nThis is nowhere near the end of the story for maximum-flow algorithms. Decades of further research have led to several faster algorithms, some of which are summarized in Figure 10.10.4 All the listed algorithms listed compute a maximum flow in several iterations. Most of these algorithms have two variants: a simpler version that performs each iteration by brute force, and a faster variant that uses sophisticated data structures to maintain a spanning tree of the flow network, so that each iteration can be performed (and the spanning tree updated) in logarithmic time. There is no reason to believe that the best algorithms known so far are optimal; indeed, maximum flows are still a very active area of research. \nThe fastest known (purely combinatorial) maximum-flow algorithm, announced by James Orlin in 2012, runs in $O ( V E )$ time, exactly matching the worst-case complexity of a flow decomposition. The details of Orlin’s algorithm are far beyond the scope of this book; in addition to his own new techniques, Orlin uses several older algorithms and data structures as black boxes, most of which are themselves quite complicated. In particular, Orlin’s algorithm does not construct an explicit flow decomposition; in fact, for graphs with only $O ( V )$ edges, an extension of his algorithm actually runs in only $O ( V ^ { 2 } / log V )$ time! Nevertheless, for purposes of analyzing algorithms that use maximum flows, this is the time bound you should cite.

Cuts are sometimes defined as subsets of the edges of the graph, instead of as partitions of its vertices. In this problem, you will prove that these two definitions are almost equivalent. \nWe say that a subset $X$ of (directed) edges separates s and $t$ if every directed path from $s$ to $t$ contains at least one (directed) edge in $X$ . For any subset $s$ of vertices, let $delta s$ denote the set of directed edges leaving $s$ ; that is, $delta S : = { u to nu mid u in S , nu not in S }$ . \n(a) Prove that if $( S , T )$ is an $( s , t )$ -cut, then $delta S$ separates $s$ and $t$ .   \n(b) Let $X$ be an arbitrary subset of edges that separates s and t. Prove that there is an $( s , t )$ -cut $( S , T )$ such that $delta S subseteq X$ .   \n(c) Let $X$ be a minimal subset of edges that separates $s$ and $t$ . (Such a set of edges is sometimes called a bond.) Prove that there is an $( s , t )$ -cut $( S , T )$ such that $delta S = X$ . \n12. Suppose instead of capacities, we consider networks where each edge $u {  } nu$ has a non-negative demand $d ( u {  } nu )$ . Now an $( s , t )$ -flow $f$ is feasible if a\u0001nd only if $f ( u to nu ) geq d ( u to nu )$ for ever\u0001y edge $u {  } nu$ . (Feasible flow values can now be arbitrari\u0001ly large.)\u0001A natural problem i\u0001n this setting is to find a feasible $( s , t )$ -flow of minimum value. \n(a) Describe an efficient algorithm to compute a feasible $( s , t )$ -flow, given the graph, the demand function, and the vertices $s$ and $t$ as input. [Hint: Find a flow that is non-zero everywhere, and then scale it up to make it feasible.]   \n(b) Suppose you have access to a subroutine MaxFlow that computes maximum flows in networks with edge capacities. Describe an efficient algorithm to compute a minimum flow in a given network with edge demands; your algorithm should call MaxFlow exactly once.   \n(c) State and prove an analogue of the max-flow min-cut theorem for this setting. (Do minimum flows correspond to maximum cuts?) \n13. For any flow network $G$ and any vertices $u$ and $nu$ , let bottleneck ${ } _ { G } ( u , nu )$ denote the maximum, over all paths $pi$ in $G$ from $u$ to $nu$ , of the minimum-capacity edge along $pi$ . \n(a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute bottlenec $mathfrak { k } _ { G } ( s , t )$ in $O ( E log V )$ time. This is the amount of flow that the Edmonds-Karp fattest-augmenting-paths algorithm pushes in the first iteration.   \n(b) Now suppose the flow network $G$ is undirected; equivalently, suppose $c ( u {  } nu ) = c ( nu {  } u )$ for every pair of vertices $u$ and $nu$ .

Describe and analyze an algorithm to construct a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ such that bottleneck ${ bf dot { mathbf { rho } } } _ { T } ( u , nu ) = b o t t l e n e c { k _ { G } ( u , nu ) }$ for all vertices $u$ and $nu$ . (Edges in $T$ inherit their capacities from $G$ .) For full credit, your algorithm should run in $O ( E )$ time. \n14. Suppose you are given a flow network $G$ with integer edge capacities and an integer maximum flow $f ^ { * }$ in $G$ . Describe algorithms for the following operations: \n(a) Increment(e): Increase the capacity of edge e by 1 and update the maximum flow.   \n(b) Decrement(e): Decrease the capacity of edge e by 1 and update the maximum flow. \nBoth algorithms should modify $f ^ { * }$ so that it is still a maximum flow, more quickly than recomputing a maximum flow from scratch. \n15. Let $G$ be a network with integer edge capacities. An edge in $G$ is upperbinding if increasing its capacity by 1 also increases the value of the maximum flow in G. Similarly, an edge is lower-binding if decreasing its capacity by 1 also decreases the value of the maximum flow in $G$ . \n(a) Does every network $G$ have at least one upper-binding edge? Prove your answer is correct.   \n(b) Does every network $G$ have at least one lower-binding edge? Prove your answer is correct.   \n(c) Describe an algorithm to find all upper-binding edges in $G$ , given both $G$ and a maximum flow in $G$ as input, in $O ( E )$ time.   \n(d) Describe an algorithm to find all lower-binding edges in $G$ , given both $G$ and a maximum flow in $G$ as input, in $O ( E V )$ time. \n16. A given flow network $G$ may have more than one minimum $( s , t )$ -cut. Let’s define the best minimum $( s , t )$ -cut to be any minimum cut $( S , T )$ with the smallest number of edges crossing from $s$ to $T$ . \n(a) Describe an efficient algorithm to find the best minimum $( s , t )$ -cut when the capacities are integers.   \n(b) Describe an efficient algorithm to find the best minimum $( s , t )$ -cut for arbitrary edge capacities.   \n(c) Describe an efficient algorithm to determine whether a given flow network contains a unique best minimum $( s , t )$ -cut. \n17. A new assistant professor, teaching maximum flows for the first time, suggests the following greedy modification to the generic Ford-Fulkerson augmenting path algorithm. Instead of maintaining a residual graph, just5 reduce the capacity of edges along the augmenting path! In particular, whenever we saturate an edge, just remove it from the graph. Who needs all that residual graph nonsense? \n(a) Show that GreedyFlow does not always compute a maximum flow.   \n(b) Show that GreedyFlow is not even guaranteed to compute a good approximation to the maximum flow. That is, for any constant $alpha > 1$ , there is a flow network $G$ such that the value of the maximum flow is more than $alpha$ times the value of the flow computed by GreedyFlow. [Hint: Assume that GreedyFlow chooses the worst possible path $pi$ at each iteration.] \n18. In 1980 Maurice Queyranne published an example of a flow network, shown below, where Edmonds and Karp’s “fattest path” heuristic does not halt. As in Zwick’s bad example for the original Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, $phi$ denotes the inverse golden ratio $( { sqrt { 5 } } - 1 ) / 2$ . The three vertical edges play essentially the same role as the horizontal edges in Zwick’s example. \n(a) Show that the following infinite sequence of path augmentations is a valid execution of the Edmonds-Karp “fattest path” algorithm. (See the bottom of Figure 10.12.) \n(b) Describe a sequence of $O ( 1 )$ path augmentations that yields a maximum flow in Queyranne’s network. \n$ \" _ { 1 9 }$ . An $( s , t )$ -series-parallel graph is a directed acyclic graph with two distinguished vertices $s$ and $t$ and with one of the following structures: \n• Base case: A single directed edge from $s$ to $t$ .   \n• Series: The union of an $( s , u )$ -series-parallel graph and a $( u , t )$ -seriesparallel graph that share a common vertex $u$ but no other vertices or edges.   \n• Parallel: The union of two smaller $( s , t )$ -series-parallel graphs with the same source $s$ and target $t$ , but with no other vertices or edges in common. \nEvery $( s , t )$ -series-parallel graph $G$ can be represented by a decomposition tree, which is a binary tree with three types of nodes: leaves (which corresponding to edges in $G$ ), series nodes (which correspond to vertices other than s and $t$ ), and parallel nodes. The same series-parallel graph could be represented by many different decomposition trees. \n(a) Suppose you are given a directed graph $G$ with two special vertices s and $t$ . Describe and analyze an algorithm that either builds a decomposition tree for $G$ or correctly reports that $G$ is not $( s , t )$ -series-parallel. [Hint: Build the tree from the bottom up.] \n(b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute a maximum $( s , t )$ -flow in a given $( s , t )$ -series-parallel flow network with arbitrary edge capacities. [Hint: In light of part (a), you can assume that you are actually given the decomposition tree. First compute the maximum-flow value, then compute an actual maximum flow.] \n20. We can speed up the Edmonds-Karp “fattest path” algorithm, at least for networks with small integer capacities, by relaxing our requirements for the next augmenting path. Instead of finding the augmenting path with maximum bottleneck capacity, we find a path whose bottleneck capacity is at least half of maximum, using the following capacity scaling algorithm. (This algorithm was actually proposed by Edmonds and Karp.) \nAssume all the edge capacities are positive integers less than $U = 2 ^ { k }$ for some integer $k$ . The scaling algorithm maintains a bottleneck threshold $triangle$ ; initially, we set $Delta  U$ . In each phase, the algorithm augments along paths from $s$ to $t$ in which every edge has residual capacity at least $Delta$ . When there is no such path, the phase ends, we set $Delta gets lfloor Delta / 2 rfloor$ , and the next phase begins. The algorithm ends when $Delta = 0$ . \n(a) How many phases will this algorithm execute in the worst case?   \n(b) Let $f$ be the flow at the end of a phase for a particular value of $triangle$ . Prove that the capacity of a minimum cut in the residual graph $G _ { f }$ is at most $E cdot Delta$ .   \n(c) Prove that in each phase of the scaling algorithm, there are at most $2 E$ augmentations.   \n(d) What is the overall running time of the capacity scaling algorithm? \nFor a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless, and then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things.

Moreover, the number of paths in this decomposition is exactly equal to the value of the flow. Extracting the actual paths from $s$ is straightforward—follow any directed path in $s$ from s to $t$ , remove that path from S, and recurse. \nConversely, we can transform any collection of $k$ edge-disjoint paths into a flow by pushing one unit of flow along each path from $s$ to $t$ ; the value of the resulting flow is exactly $k$ . It follows that any maximum flow algorithm actually computes the largest possible set of edge-disjoint paths. \n\nIf we use Orlin’s algorithm to compute maximum flows, we can compute edge-disjoint paths in $O ( V E )$ time, but Orlin’s algorithm is overkill for this simple application. The cut $( { s } , V setminus { s } )$ has capacity at most $V - 1$ , so the maximum flow has value at most $V - 1$ . Thus, Ford and Fulkerson’s original augmenting path algorithm already runs in $O ( left| f ^ { * } right| E ) = O ( V E )$ time. \nThe same algorithm can also be used to find edge-disjoint paths in undirected graphs. First, replace every undirected edge $u nu$ in $G$ with a pair of directed edges $u {  } nu$ and $nu {  } u$ , each with unit capacity, and call the resulting directed graph $G ^ { prime }$ . Next, co\u0001mpute a maximum $( s , t )$ -flow $f ^ { * }$ in $G ^ { prime }$ using Ford-Fulkerson. For any edge $u nu$ in $G$ , if $f ^ { * }$ saturates both directed edges $u {  } nu$ and $nu {  } u$ in $G ^ { prime }$ , we can remove both edges from the flow without changing\u0001its value\u0001. (More generally, we can find an acyclic maximum flow in $G ^ { prime }$ by canceling all cycles in $f ^ { * }$ , not only cycles of length 2.) Thus, without loss of generality, $f ^ { * }$ assigns a unique direction to each saturated edge. Finally, we can extract the edge-disjoint paths by searching the subgraph of directed edges saturated by $f ^ { * }$ . \n11.2 Vertex Capacities and Vertex-Disjoint Paths \nNow suppose the vertices of the input graph $G$ have capacities, not just the edges. In addition to our other constraints, for each vertex $nu$ other than $s$ and $t$ , we require the total flow into $nu$ (and therefore the total flow out of $nu$ ) to be at most some non-negative value $c ( nu )$ : \nCan we still compute maximum flows with these new vertex constraints? \nIn 1962, Ford and Fulkerson proposed the following reduction to a flow network $bar { G }$ with only edge capacities. Replace every vertex $nu$ with two vertices $nu _ { mathrm { i n } }$ and $nu _ { mathrm { o u t } }$ , connected by an edge $nu _ { mathrm { i n } } {  } nu _ { mathrm { o u t } }$ with capacity $c ( nu )$ , and then replace every directed edge $u {  } nu$ with the ed\u0001ge $u _ { mathrm { o u t } } {  } nu _ { mathrm { i n } }$ (keeping the same capacity).

A matching is a subgraph in which every vertex has degree at most one, or equivalently, a collection of edges such that no two share a vertex. The problem is to find a matching with the maximum number of edges. \nFor example, suppose we have a set of doctors who are looking for jobs, and a set of hospitals who are looking for doctors. Each doctor lists all hospitals where they are willing to work, and each hospital lists all doctors they are willing to hire. Our task is to find the largest subset of doctor-hospital hires that everyone is willing to accept.1 This problem is equivalent to finding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph whose vertices are the doctors and hospitals, and there is an edge between a doctor and a hospital if and only if each find the other acceptable. \nWe can solve this problem by reducing it to a maximum flow problem, as follows. Let $G$ be the given bipartite graph with vertex set $L cup R$ , such that every edge joins a vertex in $L$ to a vertex in $R$ . We create a new directed graph $G ^ { prime }$ by (1) orienting each edge from $L$ to $R$ , (2) adding a new source vertex s with edges to every vertex in $L$ , and (3) adding a new target vertex $t$ with edges from every vertex in $R$ . Finally, we assign every edge in $G ^ { prime }$ a capacity of 1. \nAny matching $M$ in $G$ can be transformed into a flow $f _ { M }$ in $G ^ { prime }$ as follows: For each edge uw in $M$ , push one unit of flow along the path $s {  } u {  } w {  } t$ . These paths are disjoint except at $s$ and $t$ , so the resulting flow satis\u0001fies\u0001the\u0001capacity constraints. Moreover, the value of the resulting flow is equal to the number of edges in $M$ . \nConversely, consider any $( s , t )$ -flow $f$ in $G ^ { prime }$ , computed using the FordFulkerson augmenting path algorithm. Because the edge capacities are integers, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm assigns an integer flow to every edge. (This is easy to verify by induction, hint, hint.) Moreover, since each edge has unit capacity, the computed flow either saturates $( f ( e ) = 1 )$ ) or avoids $displaystyle left( f ( e ) = 0 right)$ ) every edge in $G ^ { prime }$ . Finally, since at most one unit of flow can enter any vertex in $U$ or leave any vertex in $W$ , the saturated edges from $U$ to $W$ form a matching in $G$ . The size of this matching is exactly $| f |$ .",

A matching is a subgraph in which every vertex has degree at most one, or equivalently, a collection of edges such that no two share a vertex. The problem is to find a matching with the maximum number of edges. \nFor example, suppose we have a set of doctors who are looking for jobs, and a set of hospitals who are looking for doctors. Each doctor lists all hospitals where they are willing to work, and each hospital lists all doctors they are willing to hire.

Let $G$ be the given bipartite graph with vertex set $L cup R$ , such that every edge joins a vertex in $L$ to a vertex in $R$ . We create a new directed graph $G ^ { prime }$ by (1) orienting each edge from $L$ to $R$ , (2) adding a new source vertex s with edges to every vertex in $L$ , and (3) adding a new target vertex $t$ with edges from every vertex in $R$ . Finally, we assign every edge in $G ^ { prime }$ a capacity of 1. \nAny matching $M$ in $G$ can be transformed into a flow $f _ { M }$ in $G ^ { prime }$ as follows: For each edge uw in $M$ , push one unit of flow along the path $s {  } u {  } w {  } t$ . These paths are disjoint except at $s$ and $t$ , so the resulting flow satis\u0001fies\u0001the\u0001capacity constraints. Moreover, the value of the resulting flow is equal to the number of edges in $M$ . \nConversely, consider any $( s , t )$ -flow $f$ in $G ^ { prime }$ , computed using the FordFulkerson augmenting path algorithm. Because the edge capacities are integers, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm assigns an integer flow to every edge. (This is easy to verify by induction, hint, hint.) Moreover, since each edge has unit capacity, the computed flow either saturates $( f ( e ) = 1 )$ ) or avoids $displaystyle left( f ( e ) = 0 right)$ ) every edge in $G ^ { prime }$ . Finally, since at most one unit of flow can enter any vertex in $U$ or leave any vertex in $W$ , the saturated edges from $U$ to $W$ form a matching in $G$ . The size of this matching is exactly $| f |$ . \n\nThus, the size of the maximum matching in $G$ is equal to the value of the maximum flow in $G ^ { prime }$ , and provided we compute the maxflow using augmenting paths, we can convert the actual maxflow into a maximum matching in $O ( E )$ time. We can compute the maximum flow in $O ( V E )$ time using either Orlin’s algorithm or off-the-shelf Ford-Fulkerson. \nIt is enlightening to interpret the behavior of Ford-Fulkerson in $G ^ { prime }$ in terms of the original bipartite graph $G$ . The algorithm maintains a matching $M$ in $G$ , which is initially empty; the edges of $M$ correspond to edges in $G ^ { prime }$ that carry flow. Call a vertex of $G$ matched if is an endpoint of some edge in $M$ , and unmatched otherwise. In each iteration of the algorithm, we look for an alternating path in $G$ —a path from an unmatched vertex of $L$ to an unmatched vertex in $R$ that alternates between edges in $M$ and edges not in $M$ . (Alternating paths in $G$ correspond exactly to augmenting paths for the current flow in $G ^ { prime }$ .) If we find an augmenting path $P$ , we update $M$ to the symmetric difference $M oplus P$ , which increases the number of edges in $M$ by 1, and continue to the next iteration. If there is no alternating path, the maxflow-mincut theorem implies that $M$ is a maximum matching, so the algorithm ends. Finding a single alternating path requires $O ( E )$ time, and the algorithm halts after at most $V$ iterations, so the overall algorithm runs in $O ( V E )$ time. Figure 11.3 shows this algorithm in action. \nThis characterization of maximum bipartite matchings in terms of alternating paths was proved by Claude Berge in 1957 (independently of the maxflow-mincut theorem), although it was already implicit in algorithms described by Harald Kuhn in 1955, by Dénes Kőnig in 1916, and by Carl Jacobi around 1836. \nA more sophisticated algorithm, proposed by John Hopcroft and Richard Karp in 1973, computes maximum matchings in bipartite graphs in only $O ( sqrt { V } E )$ time, by finding several disjoint alternating paths in each iteration.",

(Optionally, we can omit edges $x {  } y$ with $c ( x , y ) = 0 .$ ) \nEvery path from $s$ to $t$ in $G$ corresponds to (or “is”) a $d$ -tuple that we could select; conversely, every selectable $d$ -tuple that satisfies the stated constraints corresponds to (or “is”) a path from $s$ to $t$ in $G$ . \nX2 B t Xd \nMore generally, let $f$ be an arbitrary feasible integer $( s , t )$ -flow in $G$ . Because all capacities are integers or $infty$ , the Flow Decomposition Theorem implies that $f$ is the sum of $| f |$ paths from $s$ to $t$ , each carrying exactly one unit of flow. Straightforward definition-chasing implies that the resulting set of tuples satisfies all the capacity constraints. Conversely, for any set of $k$ tuples that satisfies the capacity constraints, the sum of the $k$ corresponding paths is a feasible integer $( s , t )$ -flow with value $k$ . \nThus, we can select the maximum number of tuples that satisfy the given capacity constraints by computing a maximum $( s , t )$ -flow $f ^ { * }$ in $G$ and then computing a flow decomposition of $f ^ { * }$ . Because all finite capacities in $G$ are integers, we can assume without loss of generality that $f ^ { * }$ is an integer flow, and therefore (by the previous paragraph) corresponds to a valid set of $| f ^ { * } |$ tuples. \nExam Scheduling \nThe following “real world” scheduling problem might help clarify our general reduction. \nSham-Poobanana University has hired you to write an algorithm to schedule their final exams. There are $n$ different classes, each of which needs to schedule a final exam in one of $r$ rooms during one of $t$ different time slots. At most one class’s final exam can be scheduled in each room during each time slot; conversely, classes cannot be split into multiple rooms or multiple times. Moreover, each exam must be overseen by one of $p$ proctors.4 Each proctor can oversee at most one exam at a time; each proctor is available for only certain time slots; and no proctor is allowed oversee more than 5 exams total. The input to the scheduling problem consists of three arrays: \n• An integer array $E [ 1 ldots n ]$ where $E [ i ]$ is the number of students enrolled in the ith class.   \n• An integer array $S [ 1 ldots r ]$ , where $S [ j ]$ is the number of seats in the $j$ th room. The ith class’s final exam can be held in the $j$ th room if and only if $E [ i ] leq S [ j ]$ .   \n• A boolean array $A [ 1 ldots t , 1 ldots p ]$ where $A [ k , ell ] = mathrm { T }$ rue if and only if the ℓth proctor is available during the $k$ th time slot.5 \nlet $N = n + r + t p$ denote the total size of the input. Your job is to design an algorithm that either schedules a room, a time slot, and a proctor for every class’s final exam, or correctly reports that no such schedule is possible. \nThis is a standard tuple-selection problem with four resources: classes, rooms, time slots, and proctors. To solve this problem, we construct a flow network $G$ with six types of vertices—a source vertex $s ^ { prime }$ , a vertex $c _ { i }$ for each class, a vertex $r _ { j }$ for each room, a vertex $t _ { k }$ for each time slot, a vertex $p _ { ell }$ for each proctor, and a target vertex $t ^ { prime }$ —and five types of edges, as shown in Figure 11.5: \n∞ 1信 5 times rooms proctors complete classes \n• An edge $s ^ { prime } {  } c _ { i }$ with capacity 1 for each class i. (“Each class can hold at most one final ex\u0001am.”) \n• An edge $c _ { i } {  } r _ { j }$ with capacity $infty$ for each class $i$ and room $j$ such that $E [ i ] leq S [ j ]$ .\u0001(“Class $i$ can hold exams in room $j$ if and only if the room has enough seats.”) This is the only place where the enrollments $E [ i ]$ and seat numbers $S [ j ]$ are used.   \n• An edge $r _ { j } {  } t _ { k }$ with capacity 1 for each room $j$ and time slot $k$ . (“At most one exam c\u0001an be held in room $j$ at time $k$ .”)   \n• An edge $t _ { k } {  } p _ { ell }$ with capacity 1 for time slot $k$ and proctor $ell$ such that $A [ ell , k ] = { mathrm { T } } _ { mathrm { R U E } }$ . (“A proctor can oversee at most one exam at any time, and only during times that they are available.”)   \n• An edge $p _ { ell } {  } t ^ { prime }$ with capacity 5 for each proctor $ell$ . (“Each proctor can oversee at most 5 e\u0001xams.”) \n(I’m calling the source and target vertices $s ^ { prime }$ and $t ^ { prime }$ instead of $s$ and $t$ only because the problem statement already uses the variable $t$ to denote the number of time slots.) Altogether, $G$ has $n + r + t + p + 2 = O ( N )$ vertices and $O ( n r + r t + t p ) = O ( N ^ { 2 } )$ edges. \nEach path from $s ^ { prime }$ to $t ^ { prime }$ in $G$ represents a unique valid choice of class, room, time, and proctor for one final exam; specifically, the class fits into the room, and the proctor is available at that time. Conversely, for each valid choice (class, room, time, proctor), there is a corresponding path from $s ^ { prime }$ to $t ^ { prime }$ in $G$ . Thus, we can construct a valid schedule for the maximum possible number of exams by computing an maximum $( s ^ { prime } , t ^ { prime } )$ -flow $f ^ { * }$ in $G$ , decomposing $f ^ { * }$ into paths from $s ^ { prime }$ to $t ^ { prime }$ , and then transcribing each path into a class-room-time-proctor assignment. If $| f ^ { * } | = n$ , we can return the resulting schedule; otherwise, we can correctly report that scheduling all $n$ final exams is impossible. \nConstructing $G$ from the given input data by brute force takes $O ( E )$ time. We can compute the maximum flow in $O ( V E )$ time using either Ford-Fulkerson (because $| f ^ { * } | leq n < V )$ ) or Orlin’s algorithm, and we can compute the flow decomposition in $O ( V E )$ time. Thus, the overall algorithm runs in $O ( V E ) =$ $O ( N ^ { 3 } )$ time. \n11.5 Disjoint-Path Covers \nA path cover of a directed graph $G$ is a collection of directed paths in $G$ such that every vertex of $G$ lies on at least one path. A disjoint-path cover of $G$ is a path cover such that every vertex of $G$ lies on exactly one path. Every directed graph has a trivial disjoint-path cover consisting of several paths of length zero, but that’s boring. Instead, let’s look for disjoint-path covers that contain as few paths as possible. This problem is NP-hard in general—a graph has a disjoint-path cover of size 1 if and only if it contains a Hamiltonian path—but there is an efficient flow-based algorithm for directed acyclic graphs.",

The number of paths required to cover the dag is equal to the number of vertices with no successor. (And of course, every bipartite maximum matching problem is really a flow problem.) \nMinimal Faculty Hiring \nLet’s go back to Sham-Poobanana University for another “real-world” scheduling problem.6 SPU offers several thousand courses every day. Due to extreme budget cuts, the university needs to significantly reduce the size of its faculty. However, because students pay tuition (and the university cannot afford lawyers), the university must retain enough professors to guarantee that every class advertised in the course catalog is actually taught. How few professors can SPU get away with? Each remaining faculty member will be assigned a sequence of classes to teach on any given day. The classes assigned to each professor must not overlap; moreover, there must be enough slack in each professor’s schedule for them to walk from one class to the next. For purposes of this problem, let’s assume that every professor is capable of teaching every class, and that professors will not have office hours, lunches, or bathroom breaks.7 \nConcretely, suppose there are $n$ classes offered in $m$ different locations. The input to our problem consists of the following data: \n• An array $C [ 1 ldots n ]$ of classes, where each class $C [ i ]$ has three fields: the starting time $C [ i ]$ .start, the ending time $C [ i ]$ .end, and the location $C [ i ] . l o c$ . • A two-dimensional array $T [ 1 ldots m , 1 ldots m ] _ { scriptscriptstyle ; }$ , where $T [ u , nu ]$ is the time required to walk from location $u$ to location $nu$ . \nWe want to find the minimum number of professors that can collectively teach every class, such that whenever a professor is assigned to teach two classes $i$ and $j$ where $C [ j ] . s t a r t geq C [ i ]$ .start, we actually have \nWe can solve this problem by reducing it to a disjoint-path cover problem as follows. We construct a dag $G = left( V , E right)$ whose vertices are classes and whose edges represent pairs of classes that are scheduled far enough apart to be taught by the same professor. Specifically, a directed edge $i {  } j$ indicates that the same professor can teach class i and then class $j$ . It is eas\u0001y to construct this dag in $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time by brute force. Then we find a disjoint-path cover of $G$ using the matching algorithm described above; each directed path in $G$ represents a legal class schedule for one professor. The entire algorithm runs in $O ( n ^ { 2 } + V E ) =$ $O ( n ^ { 3 } )$ time.8 \n\nDespite its initial description in terms of intervals and distances, this is really a maximum matching problem (which means it’s really really a maximum-flow problem). Specifically, we want to match as many classes as possible to the next class taught by the same professor. The number of professors we need is equal to the number of classes with no assigned successor; each class without an assigned successor is the last class that some professor teaches. \n11.6 Baseball Elimination \nEvery year millions of American baseball fans eagerly watch their favorite team, hoping they will win a spot in the playoffs, and ultimately the World Series. Sadly, most teams are “mathematically eliminated” days or even weeks before the regular season ends. Often, it is easy to spot when a team is eliminated—they can’t win enough games to catch up to the current leader in their division. But sometimes the situation is more subtle.

After all, if Detroit wins all 27 of their remaining games, they will end the season with 76 wins, more than any other team has now. So as long as every other team loses every game. . . but that’s not possible, \nbecause some of those other teams still have to play each other. Here is one complete argument:10 \nBy winning all of their remaining games, Detroit can finish the season with a record of 76 and 86. If the Yankees win just 2 more games, then they will finish the season with a 77 and 85 record which would put them ahead of Detroit. So, let’s suppose the Tigers go undefeated for the rest of the season and the Yankees fail to win another game. \nThe problem with this scenario is that New York still has 8 games left with Boston. If the Red Sox win all of these games, they will end the season with at least 77 wins putting them ahead of the Tigers. Thus, the only way for Detroit to even have a chance of finishing in first place, is for New York to win exactly one of the 8 games with Boston and lose all their other games. Meanwhile, the Sox must lose all the games they play against teams other than New York. This puts them in a 3-way tie for first place.... \nNow let’s look at what happens to the Orioles and Blue Jays in our scenario. Baltimore has 2 games left with with Boston and 3 with New York. So, if everything happens as described above, the Orioles will finish with at least 76 wins. So, Detroit can catch Baltimore only if the Orioles lose all their games to teams other than New York and Boston. In particular, this means that Baltimore must lose all 7 of its remaining games with Toronto. The Blue Jays also have 7 games left with the Yankees and we have already seen that for Detroit to finish in first place, Toronto must will all of these games. But if that happens, the Blue Jays will win at least 14 more games giving them at final record of 77 and 85 or better which means they will finish ahead of the Tigers. So, no matter what happens from this point in the season on, Detroit can not finish in first place in the American League East. \nThere has to be a better way to figure this out! \nHere is a more abstract formulation of the problem. Our input consists of two arrays $W [ 1 ldots n ]$ and $G [ 1 ldots n , 1 ldots n ] _ { : }$ where $W [ i ]$ is the number of games team $i$ has already won, and $G [ i , j ]$ is the number of upcoming games between teams $i$ and $j$ . We want to determine whether team $n$ can end the season with the most wins (possibly tied with other teams).11 \nIn the mid-1960s, Benjamin Schwartz observed that this question can be modeled as a maximum flow problem; about 20 years later, Dan Gusfield, Charles Martel, and David Fernández-Baca simplified Schwartz’s flow formulation to a pair selection problem. Specifically, we want to know whether it is possible to select a winner for each game, so that team $n$ comes in first place. Let $begin{array} { r } { R [ i ] = sum _ { j } G [ i , j ] } end{array}$ denote the number of remaining games for team i. We will assume that team $n$ wins all $R [ n ]$ of its remaining games. Then team $n$ can come in first place if and only if every other team $i$ wins at most $W [ n ] + R [ n ] - W [ i ]$ of its $R [ i ]$ remaining games. \nSince we want to select a winning team for each game, we start by building a bipartite graph, whose nodes represent the games and the teams. We have $binom { n } { 2 }$ game nodes $g _ { i , j }$ , one for each pair $1 leq i < j < n$ , and $n - 1$ team nodes $t _ { i }$ , one for each $1 leq i < n$ . For each pair $i , j$ , we add edges $g _ { i , j } {  } t _ { i }$ and $g _ { i , j } {  } t _ { j }$ with infinite capacity. We add a source vertex s and edges $s mathrm { to } g _ { i , j }$ with capac\u0001ity $G [ i , j ]$ for each pair $i , j$ . Finally, we add a target node $t$ an\u0001d edges $t _ { i } {  } t$ with capacity $W [ n ] - W [ i ] + R [ n ]$ for each team i. \n\nFigure 11.7 shows the graph derived from the 1996 American League East standings, where “team $n ^ { prime prime }$ is the Detroit Tigers. All unlabeled edges have infinite capacity. \nTheorem. Team n can end the season in first place if and only if there is a feasible flow in this graph that saturates every edge leaving s. \nProof: Suppose it is possible for team $n$ to end the season in first place. Then every team $i < n$ wins at most $W [ n ] + R [ n ] - W [ i ]$ of the remaining games. For each game between team $i$ and team $j$ that team $i$ wins, add one unit of flow along the path $s {  } g _ { i , j } {  } t _ { i } {  } t$ . Because there are exactly $G [ i , j ]$ games between teams $i$ and $j$ , ev\u0001ery e\u0001dge\u0001leaving $s$ is saturated. Because each team i wins at most $W [ n ] + R [ n ] - W [ i ]$ games, the resulting flow is feasible. \nConversely, let $f$ be a feasible flow that saturates every edge out of $s$ . Suppose team $i$ wins exactly $f ( g _ { i , j } to t _ { i } )$ games against team $j$ , for all $i$ and $j$ . Then teams $i$ and $j$ play $f ( g _ { i , j } {  } t _ { i } ) + f ( g _ { i , j } {  } t _ { j } ) = f ( s {  } g _ { i , j } ) = G [ i , j ]$ games, so every upcoming game is pla\u0001yed. Moreo\u0001ver, each t\u0001eam $i$ wins a total of $begin{array} { r } { sum _ { j } f ( g _ { i , j } to t _ { i } ) = f ( t _ { i } to t ) leq W [ n ] + R [ n ] - W [ i ] } end{array}$ upcoming games, and therefore at most $W [ n ] + R [ n ]$ \u0001games overall. Thus, if team $n$ win all their upcoming games, they end the season in first place. □ \nIn summary, to decide whether our favorite team can win, we construct the flow network, compute a maximum flow, and report whether than maximum flow saturates every edge out of $s$ . For example, in the graph in Figure 11.7, the total capacity of the edges leaving $s$ is 27 (because there are 27 remaining games). On the other hand, the total capacity of the edges entering $t$ is only 26, which implies that the maximum flow value is at most 26. We conclude that Detroit is mathematically eliminated.12 \n\nThe flow network has $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ vertices and $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ edges, and it can be constructed in $O ( n ^ { 2 } )$ time. Using Orlin’s algorithm, we can compute the maximum flow in $O ( V E ) = O ( n ^ { 4 } )$ time. \nThis is not the fastest algorithm for the baseball elimination problem. In 2001, Kevin Wayne proved that one can determine all teams that are mathematically eliminated in only $O ( n ^ { 3 } )$ time, essentially using a single maximum-flow computation. \n11.7 Project Selection \nIn our final example, suppose we are given a set of $n$ projects that we could possibly perform. Some projects cannot be started until certain other projects are completed. The projects and their dependencies are described by a directed acyclic graph $G$ whose vertices are the projects, where each edge $u {  } nu$ indicates that project $u$ cannot be performed before project $nu$ . (This is exactly\u0001the form of dependency graphs we considered in Chapter 6.4.) Finally, each project $nu$ has an associated profit $$ (nu)$ which will be given to us if the project is completed; some projects have negative profits, which we interpret as positive costs. We can choose to finish any subset $X$ of the projects that includes all its dependents; that is, for every project $x in X$ , every project that $x$ depends on is also in $X$ . Our goal is to find a valid subset of the projects whose total profit is as large as possible. In particular, if all of the jobs have negative profit, the correct answer is to do nothing. \nAt a high level, our task to partition the projects into two subsets $s$ and $T$ , the jobs we Select and the jobs we Turn down. So intuitively, we’d like to model our problem as a minimum cut problem in a certain graph. But in which graph? How do we enforce prerequisites? We want to maximize profit, but we only know how to find minimum cuts. And how do we convert negative profits into positive capacities?",

So intuitively, we’d like to model our problem as a minimum cut problem in a certain graph. But in which graph? How do we enforce prerequisites? We want to maximize profit, but we only know how to find minimum cuts. And how do we convert negative profits into positive capacities? \nTo transform our given constraint graph $G$ into a flow network $G ^ { prime }$ , we add a source vertex s and a target vertex $t$ to the dependency graph, with an edge $s {  } nu$ for every profitable job $nu$ (with $$ ( nu )>0$ ), and an edge $u {  } t$ for every costly jo\u0001b $u$ (with $$ ( u)$ . Intuitively, we can think of $s$ as a new j\u0001ob (“Sleep!”) with profit/cost 0 that we must perform last. We assign capacities to the edges of $G ^ { prime }$ as follows: \n• $c ( s to nu ) = $ ( nu )$ for every profitable job $nu$ ;   \n• $c ( u  t ) = - $ 9$ for every costly job $u$ ;   \n• $c ( u to nu ) = infty$ for every dependency edge $u {  } nu$ . \nAll edge\u0001-capacities are positive, so this is a va\u0001lid input to the maximum cut problem. \nNow consider an arbitrary $( s , t )$ -cut $( S , T )$ in $G ^ { prime }$ . For any edge $u {  } nu$ in the original dependency graph, if $u in S$ and $nu in T$ , then $| S , T | = infty$ . Thu\u0001s, we can legally select the jobs in $s$ if and only if the capacity of the cut $( S , T )$ is finite. \nIn fact, it turns out that cuts with smaller capacity correspond to job selections with higher profit. Specifically, I claim that selecting the jobs in $s$ earns a total profit of $P - | S , T |$ , where $P$ is the sum of all the positive profits: \nWe can prove this claim by straightforward definition-chasing, as follows. For any subset $X$ of projects, we define three values. (Here, as usual, we define $c ( u to nu ) = 0$ when $u {  } nu$ is not an edge.) \nBy definition, $P = y i e l d ( V ) = y i e l d ( S ) + y i e l d ( T )$ . Because the cut $( S , T )$ has finite capacity, only edges of the form $s {  } nu$ and $u {  } t$ can cross the cut. By construction, every edge $s {  } nu$ points to a pro\u0001fitable job\u0001and each edge $u {  } t$ points from a costly job. Thus, $lVert S , T rVert = c o s t ( S ) + y i e l d ( T )$ . We immediately\u0001conclude that $P - | S , T | = y i e l d ( S ) - c o s t ( S ) = p r o f i t ( S )$ , as claimed. \nIt follows immediately that we can maximize our total profit by computing a minimum cut in $G ^ { prime }$ . We can easily construct $G ^ { prime }$ from $G$ in $O ( V + E )$ time, and we can compute the minimum $( s , t )$ -cut in $G ^ { prime }$ in $O ( V E )$ time using Orlin’s algorithm. We conclude that the entire project-selection algorithm runs in $O ( V E )$ time. \nExercises \n1. Let $G = left( V , E right)$ be a directed graph where for each vertex $nu$ , the in-degree and out-degree of $nu$ are equal. Suppose $G$ contains $k$ edge-disjoint paths from some vertex $u$ to another vertex $nu$ . Under these conditions, must $G$ also contain $k$ edge-disjoint paths from $nu$ to $u ?$ Give a proof or a counterexample with explanation.   \n2. Given an undirected graph $G = ( V , E )$ , with three vertices $u , nu$ , and $w$ , describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether there is a path from $u$ to $w$ that passes through $nu$ . [Hint: If $G$ were a directed graph, this problem would be NP-hard!]   \n3. Consider a directed graph $G = left( V , E right)$ with several source vertices $s _ { 1 } , s _ { 2 } , ldots , s _ { sigma }$ and target vertices $t _ { 1 } , t _ { 1 } , ldots , t _ { tau }$ , where no vertex is both a source and a target. A multi-terminal flow is a function $f : E to mathbb { R } _ { geq 0 }$ that satisfies the flow conservation constraint at every vertex that is neither a source nor a target. The value $| f |$ of a multi-terminal flow is the total excess flow out of all the source vertices: \nAs usual, we are interested in finding flows with maximum value, subject to capacity constraints on the edges. (In particular, we don’t care how much flow moves from any particular source to any particular target.) \n(a) Consider the following algorithm for computing multi-terminal flows. The variables $f$ and $f ^ { prime }$ represent flow functions. The subroutine MaxFlow $textstyle ( G , s , t )$ solves the standard maximum flow problem with source $s$ and target $t$ .",

We can easily construct $G ^ { prime }$ from $G$ in $O ( V + E )$ time, and we can compute the minimum $( s , t )$ -cut in $G ^ { prime }$ in $O ( V E )$ time using Orlin’s algorithm. We conclude that the entire project-selection algorithm runs in $O ( V E )$ time. \nExercises \n1. Let $G = left( V , E right)$ be a directed graph where for each vertex $nu$ , the in-degree and out-degree of $nu$ are equal. Suppose $G$ contains $k$ edge-disjoint paths from some vertex $u$ to another vertex $nu$ . Under these conditions, must $G$ also contain $k$ edge-disjoint paths from $nu$ to $u ?$ Give a proof or a counterexample with explanation.   \n2. Given an undirected graph $G = ( V , E )$ , with three vertices $u , nu$ , and $w$ , describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether there is a path from $u$ to $w$ that passes through $nu$ . [Hint: If $G$ were a directed graph, this problem would be NP-hard!]   \n3. Consider a directed graph $G = left( V , E right)$ with several source vertices $s _ { 1 } , s _ { 2 } , ldots , s _ { sigma }$ and target vertices $t _ { 1 } , t _ { 1 } , ldots , t _ { tau }$ , where no vertex is both a source and a target. A multi-terminal flow is a function $f : E to mathbb { R } _ { geq 0 }$ that satisfies the flow conservation constraint at every vertex that is neither a source nor a target. The value $| f |$ of a multi-terminal flow is the total excess flow out of all the source vertices: \nAs usual, we are interested in finding flows with maximum value, subject to capacity constraints on the edges. (In particular, we don’t care how much flow moves from any particular source to any particular target.) \n(a) Consider the following algorithm for computing multi-terminal flows. The variables $f$ and $f ^ { prime }$ represent flow functions. The subroutine MaxFlow $textstyle ( G , s , t )$ solves the standard maximum flow problem with source $s$ and target $t$ . \nProve that this algorithm correctly computes a maximum multi-terminal flow in $G$ . \n(b) Describe a more efficient algorithm to compute a maximum multiterminal flow in $G$ . \n4. The Island of Sodor is home to a large number of towns and villages, connected by an extensive rail network. Recently, several cases of a deadly contagious disease (either swine flu or zombies; reports are unclear) have been reported in the village of Skarloey. The controller of the Sodor railway plans to close down certain railway stations to prevent the disease from spreading to Tidmouth, his home town. No trains can pass through a closed station. To minimize expense (and public notice), he wants to close down as few stations as possible. However, he cannot close the Skarloey station, because that would expose him to the disease, and he cannot close the Tidmouth station, because then he couldn’t visit his favorite pub. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to find the minimum number of stations that must be closed to block all rail travel from Skarloey to Tidmouth. The Sodor rail network is represented by an undirected graph, with a vertex for each station and an edge for each rail connection between two stations. Two special vertices s and t represent the stations in Skarloey and Tidmouth. \nFor example, given the following input graph, your algorithm should return the integer 2. \n5. An $n times n$ grid is an undirected graph with $n ^ { 2 }$ vertices organized into $n$ rows and $n$ columns. We denote the vertex in the ith row and the $j$ th column by $( i , j )$ . Every vertex $( i , j )$ has exactly four neighbors $( i - 1 , j )$ , $( i + 1 , j )$ , $( i , j - 1 )$ , and $( i , j + 1 )$ , except the boundary vertices, for which $i = 1$ , $i = n$ , $j = 1$ , or $j = n$ . \nLet $( x _ { 1 } , y _ { 1 } ) , ( x _ { 2 } , y _ { 2 } ) , dots , ( x _ { m } , y _ { m } )$ be distinct vertices, called terminals, in the $n times n$ grid. The escape problem is to determine whether there are $m$ vertex-disjoint paths in the grid that connect the terminals to any $m$ distinct boundary vertices. \n\n(a) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to solve the escape problem. The running time of your algorithm should be a small polynomial function of $n$ .   \n(b) Now suppose the input to the escape problem consists of a single integer $n$ and the list of $m$ terminal vertices. If $m$ is very small, the previous running time is actually exponential in the input size! Describe and analyze an algorithm to solve the escape problem in time polynomial in m.   \nn(c) Modify the previous algorithm to output an explicit description of the escape paths (if they exist), still in time polynomial in m. \n6. The SPU Commuter Silence Department is installing a mini-golf course in the basement of the See-Bull Center! The playing field is a closed polygon bounded by $m$ horizontal and vertical line segments, meeting at right angles. The course has n starting points and n holes, in one-to-one correspondence. It is always possible hit the ball along a straight line directly from each starting point to the corresponding hole, without touching the boundary of the playing field. (Players are not allowed to bounce golf balls off the walls; too much glass.) The n starting points and $n$ holes are all at distinct locations. \nSadly, the architect’s computer crashed just as construction was about to begin. Thanks to the herculean efforts of their sysadmins, they were able to recover the locations of the starting points and the holes, but all information about which starting points correspond to which holes was lost! \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to compute a one-to-one correspondence between the starting points and the holes that meets the straight-line requirement, or to report that no such correspondence exists. The input consists of the $x$ - and $y$ -coordinates of the $m$ corners of the playing field, the $n$ starting points, and the $n$ holes. Assume you can determine in constant time whether two line segments intersect, given the $x$ - and $y$ -coordinates of their endpoints. \n7. A cycle cover of a given directed graph $G = ( V , E )$ is a set of vertex-disjoint cycles that cover every vertex in $G$ . Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to find a cycle cover for a given graph, or correctly report that no cycle cover exists. [Hint: Use bipartite matching!] \n8. Suppose you are given an $n times n$ checkerboard with some of the squares deleted. You have a large set of dominos, just the right size to cover two squares of the checkerboard. Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether one tile the board with dominos—each domino must cover exactly two undeleted squares, and each undeleted square must be covered by exactly one domino. \nYour input is a boolean array Deleted $left[ 1 ldots n , 1 ldots n right]$ , where Deleted $begin{array} { r l } { [ i , j ] = } & { { } } end{array}$ True if and only if the square in row i and column $j$ has been deleted. Your output is a single boolean; you do not have to compute the actual placement of dominos. For example, for the board shown in Figure 11.12, your algorithm should return True. \n牌 甩 \n9. Suppose we are given an $n times n$ square grid, some of whose squares are colored black and the rest white. Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether tokens can be placed on the grid so that \n• every token is on a white square; • every row of the grid contains exactly one token; and • every column of the grid contains exactly one token. \nYour input is a two dimensional array $I s W h i t e [ 1 dots n , 1 dots n ]$ of booleans, indicating which squares are white. Your output is a single boolean. For example, given the grid in Figure 11.13 as input, your algorithm should return True. \n10. Suppose we are given a set of boxes, each specified by their height, width, and depth in centimeters. All three side lengths of every box lie strictly between 10cm and 20cm. As you should expect, one box can be placed inside another if the first box can be rotated so that its height, width, and depth are respectively smaller than the height, width, and depth of the second box. Boxes can be nested recursively. Call a box is visible if it is not inside another box. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to nest the boxes so that the number of visible boxes is as small as possible. \n11. Suppose we are given an $n times n$ grid, some of whose cells are marked; the grid is represented by an array $M [ 1 ldots n , 1 ldots n ]$ of booleans, where $M [ i , j ] = { mathrm { T } } _ { mathrm { R U E } }$ if and only if cell $( i , j )$ is marked. A monotone path through the grid starts at the top-left cell, moves only right or down at each step, and ends at the bottom-right cell. Our goal is to cover the marked cells with as few monotone paths as possible. \n(a) Describe an algorithm to find a monotone path that covers the largest number of marked cells. \n(b) There is a natural greedy heuristic to find a small cover by monotone paths: If there are any marked cells, find a monotone path $pi$ that covers the largest number of marked cells, unmark any cells covered by $pi$ those marked cells, and recurse. Show that this algorithm does not always compute an optimal solution.   \n(c) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm to compute the smallest set of monotone paths that covers every marked cell. \n12. The Faculty Senate at Sham-Poobanana University has decided to convene a committee to determine whether Uncle Gabby, Professor Bobo Cornelius, or Mofo the Psychic Gorilla should replace the recently disgraced Baron Factotum as the new official mascot symbol of SPU’s athletic teams (The Fighting Pooh-bahs). Exactly one faculty member must be chosen from each academic department to serve on this committee. Some faculty members have appointments in multiple departments, but each committee member can represent only one department. For example, if Prof. Blagojevich is affiliated with both the Department of Corruption and the Department of Stupidity, and he is chosen as the Stupidity representative, then someone else must represent Corruption. Finally, University policy requires that every faculty committee must contain exactly the same number of assistant professors, associate professors, and full professors. Fortunately, the number of departments is a multiple of 3. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to choose a subset of the SPU faculty to staff The Post-Factotum Simian Mascot Symbol Committee, or correctly report that no valid committee is possible. Your input is a bipartite graph indicating which professors belong to which departments; each professor vertex is labeled with that professor’s rank (assistant, associate, or full). \n13. The Department of Commuter Silence at Sham-Poobanana University has a flexible curriculum with a complex set of graduation requirements. The department offers $n$ different courses, and there are $m$ different requirements. Each requirement specifies a subset of the $n$ courses and the number of courses that must be taken from that subset. The subsets for different requirements may overlap, but each course can be used to satisfy at most one requirement. \nFor example, suppose there are $n = 5$ courses $A , B , C , D , E$ and $m = 2$ graduation requirements: \n• You must take at least 2 courses from the subset ${ A , B , C }$ .   \n• You must take at least 2 courses from the subset ${ C , D , E }$ . \nThen a student who has only taken courses $B , C , D$ cannot graduate, but a student who has taken either $A , B , C , D$ or $B , C , D , E$ can graduate. \nDescribe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether a given student can graduate. The input to your algorithm is the list of $m$ requirements (each specifying a subset of the n courses and the number of courses that must be taken from that subset) and the list of courses the student has taken. \n14. You’re organizing the First Annual SPU Commuter Silence 72-Hour Dance Exchange, to be held all day Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Several 30-minute sets of music will be played during the event, and a large number of DJs have applied to perform. You need to hire DJs according to the following constraints. \n• Exactly $k$ sets of music must be played each day, and thus $3 k$ sets altogether.   \n• Each set must be played by a single DJ in a consistent music genre (ambient, bubblegum, dubstep, horrorcore, K-pop, Kwaito, mariachi, straight-ahead jazz, trip-hop, Nashville country, parapara, ska, . . . ).   \n• Each genre must be played at most once per day.   \n• Each candidate DJ has given you a list of genres they are willing to play.   \n• Each DJ can play at most three sets during the entire event. \nSuppose there are $n$ candidate DJs and $g$ different musical genres available. Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm that either assigns a DJ and a genre to each of the $3 k$ sets, or correctly reports that no such assignment is possible. \n15. Suppose you are running a web site that is visited by the same set of people every day. Each visitor claims membership in one or more demographic groups; for example, a visitor might describe himself as male, $4 0 { - } 5 0$ years old, a father, a resident of Illinois, an academic, a blogger, and a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan.13 Your site is supported by advertisers. Each advertiser has told you which demographic groups should see its ads and how many of its ads you must show each day. Altogether, there are $n$ visitors, $k$ demographic groups, and m advertisers. \nDescribe an efficient algorithm to determine, given all the data described in the previous paragraph, whether you can show each visitor exactly one ad per day, so that every advertiser has its desired number of ads displayed, and every ad is seen by someone in an appropriate demographic group. \n16. Suppose we are given an array $A [ 1 ldots m ] [ 1 ldots n ]$ of non-negative real numbers. We want to round A to an integer matrix, by replacing each entry $x$ in $A$ with either $lfloor x rfloor$ or $lceil x rceil _ {  l }$ , without changing the sum of entries in any row or column of $A .$ . For example: \n\n(a) Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm that either rounds $A$ in this fashion, or reports correctly that no such rounding is possible.   \n(b) Prove that a legal rounding is possible if and only if the sum of entries in each row is an integer, and the sum of entries in each column is an integer. In other words, prove that either your algorithm from part (a) returns a legal rounding, or a legal rounding is obviously impossible.   \nn(c) Suppose we are guaranteed that none of the entries in the input matrix $A$ is an integer. Describe and analyze an even faster algorithm that either rounds $A$ or reports correctly that no such rounding is possible. For full credit, your algorithm must run in $O ( m n )$ time. [Hint: Don’t use flows.] \n17. Ad-hoc networks are made up of low-powered wireless devices. In principle14, these networks can be used on battlefields, in regions that have recently suffered from natural disasters, and in other hard-to-reach areas. The idea is that a large collection of cheap, simple devices could be distributed through the area of interest (for example, by dropping them from an airplane); the devices would then automatically configure themselves into a functioning wireless network. \nThese devices can communicate only within a limited range. We assume all the devices are identical; there is a distance $D$ such that two devices can communicate if and only if the distance between them is at most $D$ . \nWe would like our ad-hoc network to be reliable, but because the devices are cheap and low-powered, they frequently fail. If a device detects that it is likely to fail, it should transmit its information to some other backup device within its communication range. We require each device $x$ to have $k$ potential backup devices, all within distance $D$ of $x$ ; we call these $k$ devices the backup set of $x$ . Also, we do not want any device to be in the backup set of too many other devices; otherwise, a single failure might affect a large fraction of the network. \nSo suppose we are given the communication radius $D$ , parameters $b$ and $k$ , and an array $d [ 1 ldots n , 1 ldots n ]$ of distances, where $d [ i , j ]$ is the distance between device $i$ and device $j$ . Describe an algorithm that either computes a backup set of size $k$ for each of the $n$ devices, such that no device appears in more than $b$ backup sets, or reports (correctly) that no good collection of backup sets exists. \n\n18. Faced with the threat of brutally severe budget cuts, Potemkin University has decided to hire actors to sit in classes as “students”, to ensure that every class they offer is completely full. Because actors are expensive, the university wants to hire as few of them as possible. \nBuilding on their previous leadership experience at the now-defunct Sham-Poobanana University, the administrators at Potemkin have given you a directed acyclic graph $G = left( V , E right)$ , whose vertices represent classes, and where each edge $i {  } j$ indicates that the same “student” can attend class i and then later atte\u0001nd class $j$ . In addition, you are also given an array $c a p [ 1 . . V ]$ listing the maximum number of “students” who can take each class. Describe an analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum number of “students” that would allow every class to be filled to capacity. \n19. Quentin, Alice, and the other Brakebills Physical Kids are planning an excursion through the Neitherlands to Fillory. The Neitherlands is a vast, deserted city composed of several plazas, each containing a single fountain that can magically transport people to a different world. Adjacent plazas are connected by gates, which have been cursed by the Beast. The gates between plazas are open only for five minutes every hour, all simultaneously—from 12:00 to 12:05, then from 1:00 to 1:05, and so on—and are otherwise locked. During those five minutes, if more than one person passes through any single gate, the Beast will detect their presence.15 Moreover, anyone attempting to open a locked gate, or attempting to pass through more than one gate within the same five-minute period will turn into a niffin.16 However, any number of people can safely pass through different gates at the same time and/or pass through the same gate at different times. \nYou are given a map of the Neitherlands, which is a graph $G$ with a vertex for each fountain and an edge for each gate, with the fountains to Earth and Fillory clearly marked. \n(a) Suppose you are also given a positive integer $h$ . Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the maximum number of people that can walk from the Earth fountain to the Fillory fountain in at most $h$ hours—that is, after the gates have opened at most $h$ times—without anyone alerting the Beast or turning into a niffin. The running time of your algorithm should depend on h. [Hint: Build a different graph.] \n${ mathfrak { s v } } _ { ( mathrm { b } ) }$ Describe an analyze an algorithm for part (a) whose running time is polynomial in $V$ and $E$ , with no dependence on $h$ . (c) On the other hand, suppose you are also given an integer $k$ . Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the minimum number of hours that allow $k$ people to walk from the Earth fountain to the Fillory fountain, without anyone alerting the Beast or turning into a niffin. [Hint: Use part (a).] n20. Let $G = left( L sqcup R , E right)$ be a bipartite graph, whose left vertices $L$ are indexed $ell _ { 1 } , ell _ { 2 } , ldots , ell _ { n }$ and whose right vertices are indexed $r _ { 1 } , r _ { 2 } , ldots , r _ { n }$ . A matching $M$ in $G$ is non-crossing if, for every pair of edges $ell _ { i } r _ { j }$ and $ell _ { i ^ { prime } } r _ { j ^ { prime } }$ in $M$ , we have $i < i ^ { prime }$ if and only if $j < j ^ { prime }$ . (a) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the largest non-crossing matching in $G$ . [Hint: This is not really a flow problem.] (b) Describe and analyze an algorithm to find the smallest number of noncrossing matchings $M _ { 1 } , M _ { 2 } , ldots , M _ { k }$ such that each edge in $G$ is in exactly one matching $M _ { i }$ . [Hint: This is really a flow problem.] \n$phantom { - } 2 1$ . Let $G = left( L sqcup R , E right)$ be a bipartite graph, whose left vertices $L$ are indexed $ell _ { 1 } , ell _ { 2 } , ldots , ell _ { n }$ in some arbitrary order. \n(a) A matching $M$ in $G$ is dense if there are no consecutive unmatched vertices in $L$ ; that is, for each index i, at least one of the vertices $ell _ { i }$ and $ell _ { i + 1 }$ is incident to an edge in $M$ . Describe an algorithm to determine whether $G$ has a dense matching.   \n(b) A matching $M$ in $G$ is sparse if there are no consecutive matched vertices in $L$ ; that is, for each index $i$ , at least one of the vertices $ell _ { i }$ and $ell _ { i + 1 }$ is not incident to an edge in $M$ . (In particular, the empty matching is sparse.) Describe an algorithm to find the largest sparse matching in $G$ .   \n(c) A matching $M$ in $G$ is palindromic if, for every index $i$ , either $ell _ { i }$ and $ell _ { n - i + 1 }$ are both incident to edges in $M$ , or neither $ell _ { i }$ nor $ell _ { n - i + 1 }$ is incident to an edge in $M$ . (In particular, the empty matching is palindromic.) Describe an algorithm to find the largest palindromic matching in $G$ . \nNone of these problems restrict which vertices in $R$ are matched or unmatched. \nn22. A rooted tree is a directed acyclic graph, in which every vertex has exactly one incoming edge, except for the root, which has no incoming edges. Equivalently, a rooted tree consists of a root vertex, which has edges pointing to the roots of zero or more smaller rooted trees. Describe an efficient algorithm to compute, given two rooted trees $A$ and $B$ , the largest rooted tree that is isomorphic to both a subgraph of $A$ and a subgraph of $B$ . More briefly, describe an algorithm to find the largest common subtree of two rooted trees. \n\n[Hint: This would be a relatively straightforward dynamic programming problem if either every node had $O ( 1 )$ children or the children of each node were ordered from left to right. But for unordered trees with large degree, you need another technique to combine recursive subproblems efficiently.] [I]n his short and broken treatise he provides an eternal example—not of laws, or even of method, for there is no method except to be very intelligent, but of intelligence itself swiftly operating the analysis of sensation to the point of principle and definition. \n\n— T.

The salesman tells you that the state of the light bulb is controlled by a complex boolean circuit—a collection of And, Or, and Not gates connected by wires, with one input wire for each switch and a single output wire for the bulb. He then asks you a simple question: Is it possible to set the switches so that the light bulb turns on? If you can answer this question correctly, he will give you one million one hundred billion dollars; if you answer incorrectly, or if you die without answering, he will take your soul. \nAs far as you can tell, the Adversary hasn’t connected the switches to the light bulb at all, so no matter how you set the switches, the light bulb will stay off. If you declare that it is possible to turn on the light, the Adversary will open the box and reveal that there is no circuit at all. But if you declare that it is not possible to turn on the light, before testing all $2 ^ { n }$ settings, the Adversary will magically create a circuit inside the box that turns on the light if and only if the switches are in one of the settings you haven’t tested, and then flip the switches to that setting, turning on the light. (You can’t detect the Adversary’s cheating, because you can’t see inside the box until the end.) The only way to provably answer the Adversary’s question correctly is to try all $2 ^ { n }$ possible settings. You quickly realize that this will take far longer than you expect to live, so you gracefully decline the Adversary’s offer. \nThe Adversary smiles and says, in a growl like Heath Ledger’s Joker after smoking a carton of Marlboros, “Ah, yes, of course, you have no reason to trust me. But perhaps I can set your mind at ease.” He hands you a large roll of parchment—which you hope was made from sheep skin—with a circuit diagram drawn (or perhaps tattooed) on it. “Here are the complete plans for the circuit inside the box. Feel free to poke around inside the box to make sure the plans are correct. Or build your own circuit from these plans. Or write a computer program to simulate the circuit. Whatever you like. If you discover that the plans don’t match the actual circuit in the box, you win the hundred billion bucks.” A few spot checks convince you that the plans have no obvious flaws; subtle cheating appears to be impossible. \nBut you should still decline the Adversary’s “generous” offer. The problem that the Adversary is posing is called circuit satisfiability or CircuitSat: Given a boolean circuit, is there a set of inputs that makes the circuit output True, or conversely, whether the circuit always outputs False. For any particular input setting, we can calculate the output of the circuit in polynomial (actually, linear) time using depth-first-search. But nobody knows how to solve CircuitSat faster than trying all $2 ^ { n }$ possible inputs to the circuit by brute force, which requires exponential time. Admittedly, nobody has actually formally proved that we can’t beat brute force—maybe, just maybe, there’s a clever algorithm that just hasn’t been discovered yet—but nobody has actually formally proved that anti-gravity unicorns don’t exist, either. For all practical purposes, it’s safe to assume that there is no fast algorithm for CircuitSat. \n\nYou tell the salesman no. He smiles and says, “You’re smarter than you look, kid,” and then flies away on his anti-gravity unicorn. \n12.2 P versus NP \nA minimal requirement for an algorithm to be considered “efficient” is that its running time is bounded by a polynomial function of the input size: $O ( n ^ { c } )$ for some constant $c$ , where $n$ is the size of the input.1 Researchers recognized early on that not all problems can be solved this quickly, but had a hard time figuring out exactly which ones could and which ones couldn’t. There are several so-called NP-hard problems, which most people believe cannot be solved in polynomial time, even though nobody can prove a super-polynomial lower bound. \nA decision problem is a problem whose output is a single boolean value: Yes or No. Let me define three classes of decision problems: \n• $P$ is the set of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time. Intuitively, P is the set of problems that can be solved quickly. • NP is the set of decision problems with the following property: If the answer is Yes, then there is a proof of this fact that can be checked in polynomial time. Intuitively, NP is the set of decision problems where we can verify a Yes answer quickly if we have the solution in front of us. • co-NP is essentially the opposite of NP. If the answer to a problem in co-NP is No, then there is a proof of this fact that can be checked in polynomial time. \nFor example, the circuit satisfiability problem is in NP. If a given boolean circuit is satisfiable, then any set of $m$ input values that produces True output is a proof that the circuit is satisfiable; we can check the proof by evaluating the circuit in polynomial time. It is widely believed that circuit satisfiability is not in P or in co-NP, but nobody actually knows. \nEvery decision problem in P is also in NP. If a problem is in P, we can verify Yes answers in polynomial time recomputing the answer from scratch! Similarly, every problem in P is also in co-NP.",

He smiles and says, “You’re smarter than you look, kid,” and then flies away on his anti-gravity unicorn. \n12.2 P versus NP \nA minimal requirement for an algorithm to be considered “efficient” is that its running time is bounded by a polynomial function of the input size: $O ( n ^ { c } )$ for some constant $c$ , where $n$ is the size of the input.1 Researchers recognized early on that not all problems can be solved this quickly, but had a hard time figuring out exactly which ones could and which ones couldn’t. There are several so-called NP-hard problems, which most people believe cannot be solved in polynomial time, even though nobody can prove a super-polynomial lower bound. \nA decision problem is a problem whose output is a single boolean value: Yes or No. Let me define three classes of decision problems: \n• $P$ is the set of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time. Intuitively, P is the set of problems that can be solved quickly. • NP is the set of decision problems with the following property: If the answer is Yes, then there is a proof of this fact that can be checked in polynomial time. Intuitively, NP is the set of decision problems where we can verify a Yes answer quickly if we have the solution in front of us. • co-NP is essentially the opposite of NP. If the answer to a problem in co-NP is No, then there is a proof of this fact that can be checked in polynomial time. \nFor example, the circuit satisfiability problem is in NP. If a given boolean circuit is satisfiable, then any set of $m$ input values that produces True output is a proof that the circuit is satisfiable; we can check the proof by evaluating the circuit in polynomial time. It is widely believed that circuit satisfiability is not in P or in co-NP, but nobody actually knows. \nEvery decision problem in P is also in NP. If a problem is in P, we can verify Yes answers in polynomial time recomputing the answer from scratch! Similarly, every problem in P is also in co-NP. \nPerhaps the single most important unanswered question in theoretical computer science—if not all of computer science—if not all of science—is whether the complexity classes $mathrm { ~ bf ~ P ~ }$ and NP are actually different. Intuitively, it seems obvious to most people that ${ mathrm { P } } neq { mathrm { N P } }$ ; the homeworks and exams in your algorithms and data structures classes have (I hope) convinced you that problems can be incredibly hard to solve, even when the solutions are simple in retrospect. It’s completely obvious; of course solving problems from scratch is harder than verifying that a given solution is correct. We can reasonably accept—and most algorithm designers do accept—the statement $mathrm { { } ^ { mathfrak { s } } P ne N P ^ { prime prime } }$ as a law of nature, similar to other laws of nature like Maxwell’s equations, general relativity, and the sun rising tomorrow morning that are strongly supported by evidence, but have no mathematical proof. \nBut if we’re being mathematically rigorous, we have to admit that nobody knows how to prove that that ${ mathrm { P } } neq { mathrm { N P } }$ . In fact, there has been little or no real progress toward a proof for decades.2 The Clay Mathematics Institute lists P-versus-NP as the first of its seven Millennium Prize Problems, offering a $$ 1$ ,000,000 reward for its solution. And yes, in fact, several people have lost their souls, or at least their sanity, attempting to solve this problem. \nA more subtle but still open question is whether the complexity classes NP and co-NP are different. Even if we can verify every Yes answer quickly, there’s no reason to believe we can also verify No answers quickly. For example, as far as we know, there is no short proof that a boolean circuit is not satisfiable. It is generally believed that $mathrm { N P } neq mathrm { c o - N P }$ , but again, nobody knows how to prove it. \n12.3 NP-hard, NP-easy, and NP-complete \nA problem $Pi$ is NP-hard if a polynomial-time algorithm for $Pi$ would imply a polynomial-time algorithm for every problem in NP. In other words: \nΠ is NP-hard $Longleftrightarrow$ If Π can be solved in polynomial time, then $scriptstyle mathbf { P } = mathbf { N P }$",

In other words: \nΠ is NP-hard $Longleftrightarrow$ If Π can be solved in polynomial time, then $scriptstyle mathbf { P } = mathbf { N P }$ \nIntuitively, if we could solve one particular NP-hard problem quickly, then we could quickly solve any problem whose solution is easy to understand, using the solution to that one special problem as a subroutine. NP-hard problems are at least as hard as every problem in NP. \nFinally, a problem is NP-complete if it is both NP-hard and an element of NP (or “NP-easy”). Informally, NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in NP. A polynomial-time algorithm for even one NP-complete problem would immediately imply a polynomial-time algorithm for every NP-complete problem. Literally thousands of problems have been shown to be NP-complete, so a polynomial-time algorithm for one (and therefore all) of them seems incredibly unlikely. \nCalling a problem NP-hard is like saying “If I own a dog, then it can speak fluent English.” You probably don’t know whether or not I own a dog, but I bet you’re pretty sure that I don’t own a talking dog. Nobody has a mathematical proof that dogs can’t speak English—the fact that no one has ever heard a dog speak English is evidence, as are the hundreds of examinations of dogs that lacked the proper mouth shape and brainpower, but mere evidence is not a mathematical proof. Nevertheless, no sane person would believe me if I said I owned a dog that spoke fluent English.3 So the statement “If I own a dog, then it can speak fluent English” has a natural corollary: No one in their right mind should believe that I own a dog! Similarly, if a problem is NP-hard, no one in their right mind should believe it can be solved in polynomial time. \nIt is not immediately obvious that any problems are NP-hard. The following remarkable theorem was first published by Stephen Cook in 1971 and independently by Leonid Levin in 1973.4 \nThe Cook-Levin Theorem. Circuit satisfiability is NP-hard. \nI won’t even sketch a proof here, because I’ve been (deliberately) vague about the definitions.5 \nn12.4 Formal Definitions (HC SVNT DRACONES) \nFormally, the complexity classes P, NP, and co-NP are defined in terms of languages and Turing machines. A language is a set of strings over some finite alphabet $Sigma$ ; without loss of generality, we can assume that $Sigma = { emptyset , 1 }$ . A Turing machine is a very restrictive type of computer—crudely, a finite-state machine with an unbounded memory tape—whose precise definition is surprisingly unimportant. P is the set of languages that can be decided in Polynomial time by a deterministic single-tape Turing machine. Similarly, NP is the set of all languages that can be decided in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine; NP is an abbreviation for Nondeterministic Polynomial-time. \nThe requirement of polynomial time is sufficiently crude that we do not have to specify the precise form of Turing machine (number of tapes, number of heads, number of tracks, size of the tape alphabet, and so on). In fact, any algorithm that runs on a random-access machine6 in $T ( n )$ time can be simulated by a single-tape, single-track, single-head Turing machine that runs in $O ( T ( n ) ^ { 4 } )$ time. This simulation result allows us to argue formally about computational complexity in terms of standard high-level programming constructs like arrays and loops and recursion, instead of describing everything directly in terms of Turing machines. \nFormally, a problem $Pi$ is NP-hard if and only if, for every language $Pi ^ { prime } in mathrm { N P }$ , there is a polynomial-time Turing reduction from $Pi ^ { prime }$ to $Pi$ . A Turing reduction means a reduction that can be executed on a Turing machine; that is, a Turing machine $M$ that can solve $Pi ^ { prime }$ using another Turing machine $M ^ { prime }$ for $Pi$ as a black-box subroutine. Turing reductions are also called oracle reductions; polynomial-time Turing reductions are also called Cook reductions.",

Reducing problem A to another problem B means describing an algorithm to solve problem A under the assumption that an algorithm for problem B already exists. You’ve already been doing reduction for years, even before starting this book, only you probably called them something else, like subroutines or utility functions or modular programming or using a calculator. To prove something is NP-hard, we describe a similar transformation between problems, but not in the direction that most people expect. \nYou should tattoo the following rule of onto the back of your hand, right next to your mom’s birthday and the actual rules of Monopoly.7 \nTo prove that problem A is NP-hard, reduce a known NP-hard problem to A. \nIn other words, to prove that your problem is hard, you need to describe an efficient algorithm to solve a different problem, which you already know is hard, using an hypothetical efficient algorithm for your problem as a black-box subroutine. The essential logic is a proof by contradiction. The reduction implies that if your problem were easy, then the other problem would be easy, which it ain’t. Equivalently, since you know the other problem is hard, the reduction implies that your problem must also be hard; your hypothetical efficient algorithm does not actually exist. \nAs a canonical example, consider the formula satisfiability problem, usually just called Sat. The input to Sat is a boolean formula like \nand the question is whether it is possible to assign boolean values to the variables $a , b , c , ldots$ so that the entire formula evaluates to True. \nTo prove that Sat is NP-hard, we need to give a reduction from a known NP-hard problem. The only problem we know is NP-hard so far is CircuitSat, so let’s start there. \nLet $K$ be an arbitrary boolean circuit. We can transform (or more accurately, transcribe) $K$ into a boolean formula $Phi$ as follows. First, label each interior wire by a new variable $y _ { j }$ , and label the output wire with a new variable $z$ . The formula $Phi$ consists of a list of equations, one for each gate, separated by Ands, followed by a final $wedge z$ . Figure 12.5 shows the resulting transcription for our example circuit. \nNow we claim that the original circuit $K$ is satisfiable if and only if the resulting formula $Phi$ is satisfiable. Like every other “if and only if” statement, we prove this claim in two steps: \n$Rightarrow$ Given a set of inputs that satisfy the circuit $K$ , we can derive a satisfying assignment for the formula $Phi$ by computing the output of every gate in $K$ .   \n$Leftarrow$ Given a satisfying assignment for the formula $Phi$ , we can obtain a satisfying input the circuit by simply ignoring the internal wire variables $y _ { i }$ and the output variable $z$ . \nThe entire transformation from circuit to formula can be carried out in linear time. Moreover, the size of the resulting formula is at most a constant factor larger than any reasonable representation of the circuit. \nNow suppose, for the sake of argument, there is an algorithm that can determine in polynomial time whether a given boolean formula is satisfiable. Then given any boolean circuit $K$ , we can decide whether $K$ is satisfiable by first transforming $K$ into a boolean formula $Phi$ as described above, and then asking our magical mystery Sat algorithm whether $Phi$ is satisfiable, as suggested by the following cartoon. Each box represents an algorithm. The red box on the left is the transformation subroutine. The box on the right is the hypothetical magic Sat algorithm. It must be magic, because it has a rainbow on it.8 \nIf you prefer magic pseudocode to magic boxes: \nTranscribing $K$ into $Phi$ requires only polynomial time (in fact, only linear time, but whatever), so the entire CircuitSat algorithm also runs in polynomial time. \nWe conclude that any polynomial-time algorithm for Sat would give us a polynomial-time algorithm for CircuitSat, which in turn would imply $mathrm { P = N P } .$ . So Sat is NP-hard! \n12.6 3SAT (from CIRCUITSAT) \nA special case of Sat that is particularly useful in proving NP-hardness results is called 3CNF-Sat or more often simply 3Sat. \nA boolean formula is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) if it is a conjunction (and) of several clauses, each of which is the disjunction (or) of several literals, each of which is either a variable or its negation. For example: \nA $3 C N F$ formula is a CNF formula with exactly three literals per clause; the previous example is not a $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula, since its first clause has four literals and its last clause has only two. $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ is the restriction of Sat to 3CNF formulas: Given a $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula, is there an assignment to the variables that makes the formula evaluate to True? \nWe could prove that $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ is NP-hard by a reduction from the more general Sat problem, but it’s actually easier to start over from scratch, by reducing directly from CircuitSat. \nGiven an arbitrary boolean circuit $K$ , we transform $K$ into an equivalent $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula in several stages. Except for the very last stage, this reduction was actually described by Grigorii Tseitin in 1966, five years before Cook and Levin reported their proofs of the Cook-Levin Theorem. (In the same 1966 paper, Tseitin described the problem we now call CNF-Sat, possibly for the first time.) As we describe each stage, we will also prove that stage is correct.",

As we describe each stage, we will also prove that stage is correct. \n\n• Make sure every and and or gate in $K$ has exactly two inputs. If any gate has $k > 2$ inputs, replace it with a binary tree of $k - 1$ binary gates. Call the resulting circuit $K ^ { prime }$ . The circuits $K$ and $K ^ { prime }$ are logically equivalent circuits, so every satisfying input for $K$ is a satisfying input for $K ^ { prime }$ and vice versa. \n• Transcribe $K ^ { prime }$ into a boolean formula $Phi _ { 1 }$ with one clause per gate, exactly as in our previous reduction to Sat. We already proved that every satisfying input for $K ^ { prime }$ can be transformed into a satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 1 }$ and vice versa. \n• Replace each clause in $Phi _ { 1 }$ with a CNF formula. There are only three types of clauses in $Phi _ { 1 }$ , one for each type of gate in $K ^ { prime }$ : \nCall the resulting CNF formula $Phi _ { 2 }$ . Because $Phi _ { 1 }$ and $Phi _ { 2 }$ are logically equivalent formulas, every satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 1 }$ is also a satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 2 }$ , and vice versa. \n• Replace each clause in $Phi _ { 2 }$ with a 3CNF formula. Every clause in $Phi _ { 2 }$ has at most three literals, but we need clauses with exactly three literals. To obtain a $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula, we expand each two-literal clause in $Phi _ { 2 }$ into two three-literal clauses by introducing one new variable, and we expand the final one-literal clause in $Phi _ { 2 }$ into four three-literal clauses by introducing two new variables. \nCall the resulting $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula $Phi _ { 3 }$ . Every satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 2 }$ can be transformed into a satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 3 }$ by assigning arbitrary values to the new variables ( $dot { boldsymbol { x } }$ and $y$ ). Conversely, every satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 3 }$ can be transformed into a satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 2 }$ by ignoring the new variables. \nFor example, our example circuit is transformed into the following 3CNF formula;   \ncompare with Figure 12.5. \nYikes! At first glance, this formula might look a lot more complicated than the original circuit, but in fact, it’s only larger by a constant factor. Specifically, the simplified circuit $K ^ { prime }$ has at most twice as many wires as the original circuit $K$ , each binary gate in $K ^ { prime }$ is transformed into at most five clauses in $Phi _ { 3 }$ . Even if the formula size were a large polynomial function (like $n ^ { 3 7 4 }$ ) of the circuit size, we would still have a valid reduction. \nOur reduction transforms an arbitrary boolean circuit $K$ into a $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula $Phi _ { 3 }$ in polynomial time (in fact, in linear time). Moreover, any satisfying input for the input circuit $K$ can be transformed into a satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 3 }$ , and any satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 3 }$ can be transformed into a satisfying input for $K$ . In other words, $K$ is satisfiable if and only if $Phi _ { 3 }$ is satisfiable. Thus, if $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ can be solved in polynomial time, then CircuitSat can be solved in polynomial time, which implies that $mathrm { { P } = mathrm { { N P } . } }$ We conclude that 3Sat is NP-hard. \n12.7 Maximum Independent Set (from 3SAT) \nFor the next few problems we consider, the input is a simple, unweighted, undirected graph, and the problem asks for the size of the largest or smallest subgraph satisfying some structural property. \nLet $G$ be an arbitrary graph. An independent set in $G$ is a subset of the vertices of $G$ with no edges between them. The maximum independent set problem, which I’ll abbreviate MaxIndSet, asks for the size of the largest independent set in a given graph. I will prove that MaxIndSet is NP-hard using a reduction from $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ , as suggested by Figure 12.7. \nGiven an arbitrary $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula $Phi$ , we construct a graph $G$ as follows. Let $k$ denote the number of clauses in $Phi$ . The graph $G$ contains exactly $3 k$ vertices, one for each literal in $Phi$ . Two vertices in $G$ are connected by an edge if and only if either (1) they correspond to literals in the same clause, or (2) they correspond to a variable and its inverse. For example, the formula $( a vee b vee c ) wedge ( b vee bar { c } vee bar { d } ) wedge ( bar { a } vee c vee d ) wedge ( a vee bar { b } vee bar { d } )$ is transformed into the graph shown in Figure 12.8.",

An independent set in $G$ is a subset of the vertices of $G$ with no edges between them. The maximum independent set problem, which I’ll abbreviate MaxIndSet, asks for the size of the largest independent set in a given graph. I will prove that MaxIndSet is NP-hard using a reduction from $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ , as suggested by Figure 12.7. \nGiven an arbitrary $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula $Phi$ , we construct a graph $G$ as follows. Let $k$ denote the number of clauses in $Phi$ . The graph $G$ contains exactly $3 k$ vertices, one for each literal in $Phi$ . Two vertices in $G$ are connected by an edge if and only if either (1) they correspond to literals in the same clause, or (2) they correspond to a variable and its inverse. For example, the formula $( a vee b vee c ) wedge ( b vee bar { c } vee bar { d } ) wedge ( bar { a } vee c vee d ) wedge ( a vee bar { b } vee bar { d } )$ is transformed into the graph shown in Figure 12.8. \nEach independent set in $G$ contains at most one vertex from each clause triangle, because any two vertices in each triangle are connected. Thus, the largest independent set in $G$ has size at most $k$ . I claim that $G$ contains an independent set of size exactly $k$ if and only if the original formula $Phi$ is satisfiable. As usual for “if and only if” statements, the proof consists of two parts. \n$Rightarrow$ Suppose $Phi$ is satisfiable. Fix an arbitrary satisfying assignment. By definition, each clause in $Phi$ contains at least one True literal. Thus, we can choose a subset $s$ of $k$ vertices in $G$ that contains exactly one vertex per clause triangle, such that the corresponding $k$ literals are all True. Because each triangle contains at most one vertex in $s$ , no two vertices in $s$ are connected by a triangle edge. Because every literal corresponding to a vertex in $s$ is True, no two vertices in $s$ are connected by a negation edge. We conclude that $s$ is an independent set of size $k$ in $G$ . \n$Leftarrow mathrm { O n }$ the other hand, suppose $G$ contains an independent set $s$ of size $k$ . Each vertex in $s$ must lie in a different clause triangle. Suppose we assign the value True to each literal in $s$ ; because contradictory literals are connected by edges, this assignment is consistent. There may be variables $x$ such that neither $x$ nor $bar { x }$ corresponds to a vertex in $s$ ; we can set these variables to any value we like. Because $s$ contains one vertex in each clause triangle, each clause in $Phi$ contains (at least) one True literal. We conclude that $Phi$ is satisfiable. \n\nTransforming the $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula $Phi$ into the graph $G$ takes polynomial time, even if we do everything by brute force. Thus, if we could solve MaxIndSet in polynomial time, then we could also solve $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ in polynomial time, by transforming the input formula $Phi$ into a graph $G$ and comparing the size of the largest independent set in $G$ with the number of clauses in $Phi$ . But that would imply $mathrm { P = N P } ,$ , which is ridiculous! We conclude that MaxIndSet is NP-hard. \n12.8 The General Pattern \nAll NP-hardness proofs—and more generally, all polynomial-time reductions— follow the same general outline. To reduce problem $X$ to problem $Y$ in polynomial time, we need to do three things: \n1. Describe a polynomial-time algorithm to transform an arbitrary instance of $x$ of $X$ into a special instance $y$ of $Y$ .   \n2. Prove that if $x$ is a “good” instance of $X$ , then $y$ is a “good” instance of $Y$ .   \n3. Prove that if $y$ is a “good” instance of $Y$ , then $x$ is a “good” instance of $X$ . (This is usually the part that causes the most trouble.) \nOf course, developing a correct reduction doesn’t mean handling these three tasks one at a time. First writing down an algorithm that seems to work and then trying prove that it actually works is rarely successful, especially in time-limited settings like exams. We must develop the algorithm, the “if” proof, and the “only if” proof simultaneously. \nTo quote the late great Ricky Jay:9 This is an acquired skill. \nOne point that confuses many students is that the reduction algorithm only “works one way”—from $X$ to $Y$ —but the correctness proof needs to “work both ways”. But the correctness proofs are not actually symmetric. The “if” proof needs to handle arbitrary instances of $X$ , but the “only if” only needs to handle the special instances of $Y$ produced by the reduction algorithm. Exploiting this asymmetry is the key to successfully designing correct reductions. \nI find it useful to think in terms of transforming certificates—proofs that a given instance is “good”—along with the instances themselves. For example, a certificate for CircuitSat is a set of inputs that turns on the light bulb; a certificate for Sat or $3 S mathrm { A T }$ is a satisfying assignment; a certificate for MaxIndSet is a large independent set. To reduce $X$ to $Y$ , we actually need to design three algorithms, one for each of the following tasks:",

To reduce $X$ to $Y$ , we actually need to design three algorithms, one for each of the following tasks: \n• Transform an arbitrary instance $x$ of $X$ into a special instance y of $Y$ in polynomial time. • Transform an arbitrary certificate for $x$ into a certificate for $y$ , and • Transform an arbitrary certificate for $y$ into a certificate for $x$ . \nThe second and third tasks refer to the input and output of the first algorithm. The certificate transformation needs to be reversible, not the instance transformation. We never have to transform instances of $Y$ , and we don’t need to think about arbitrary instances of Y at all. Only the first algorithm needs to run in polynomial time (although in practice, the second and third algorithms are almost always simpler than the first). \nFor example, our reduction from CircuitSat to $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ consists of three algorithms: \n• The first transforms an arbitrary boolean circuit $K$ into a special 3CNF boolean formula $Phi _ { 3 }$ , in polynomial time. (Encode each wire as a variable and each gate as a sub-formula, and then expand each sub-formula into 3CNF.)   \n• The second transforms an arbitrary satisfying input for $K$ into a satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 3 }$ . (Trace the input through the circuit, transfer values from each wire to the corresponding variable, and give any additional variables arbitrary values.)   \n• The third transforms an arbitrary satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 3 }$ into a satisfying input for $K$ . (Transfer values from each wire variable in $Phi _ { 3 }$ to the corresponding wire in $K$ .) \nThe reduction works because the first algorithm encodes any boolean circuit $K$ into a highly structured $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula $Phi _ { 3 }$ . The specific structure of $Phi _ { 3 }$ restricts how it can be satisfied; every satisfying assignment for $Phi _ { 3 }$ must “come from” some satisfying input for $K$ . We don’t have to think about arbitrary 3CNF formulas at all. \nSimilarly, our reduction from $3 S mathrm { A T }$ to MaxIndSet consists of three algorithms: \n• The first transforms an arbitrary $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula $Phi$ into a special graph $G$ and a specific integer $k$ , in polynomial time.   \n• The second transforms an arbitrary satisfying assignment for $Phi$ into an independent set in $G$ of size $k$ .   \n• The third transforms an arbitrary independent set in $G$ of size $k$ into a satisfying assignment for $Phi$ . \nAgain, our first transformation encodes the input formula $Phi$ into a highly structured graph $G$ and a specific integer $k$ . The structure of $G$ ensures that every independent set of size $k$ “comes from” a satisfying assignment for $Phi$ . We don’t consider arbitrary graphs or arbitrary independent set sizes at all. \n12.9 Clique and Vertex Cover (from Independent Set) \nA clique is another name for a complete graph, that is, a graph where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The MaxClique problem asks for the number of nodes in its largest complete subgraph in a given graph. A vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices that touches every edge in the graph. The MinVertexCover problem asks for the size of the smallest vertex cover in a given graph. \nWe can prove that MaxClique is NP-hard using the following easy reduction from MaxIndSet. Any graph $G$ has an edge-complement $overline { { G } }$ with the same vertices, but with exactly the opposite set of edges—uv is an edge in $overline { { G } }$ if and only if $u nu$ is not an edge in $G$ . A set of vertices is independent in $G$ if and only if the same vertices define a clique in $overline { { G } }$ . Thus, the largest independent in $G$ has the same vertices (and thus the same size) as the largest clique in the complement of $G$ . \nThe proof that MinVertexCover is NP-hard is even simpler, because it relies on the following easy observation: $I$ is an independent set in a graph $G = ( V , E )$ if and only if its complement $V setminus I$ is a vertex cover of the same graph $G$ . Thus, the largest independent set in any graph is the complement of the smallest vertex cover of the same graph! Thus, if the smallest vertex cover in an $n$ -vertex graph has size $k$ , then the largest independent set has size $n - k$ .",

(The “colors” are really arbitrary labels, which for simplicity we represent by small positive integers, rather than electromagnetic frequencies, CMYK vectors, or Pantone numbers, for example.) The graph coloring problem asks for the smallest possible number of colors in a legal coloring of a given graph. \nTo prove that graph coloring is NP-hard, it suffices to consider the decision problem 3Color: Given a graph, does it have a proper 3-coloring? We prove 3Color is NP-hard using a reduction from 3Sat. (Why 3Sat? Because it has a 3 in it. You probably think $mathrm { I ^ { prime } m }$ joking, but I’m not.) Given a $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula $Phi$ , we construct a graph $G$ that is 3-colorable if and only if $Phi$ is satisfiable, as suggested by the usual diagram. \nWe describe the reduction using a standard strategy of decomposing the output graph $G$ into gadgets, subgraphs that enforce various semantics of the input formula $Phi$ in the language of graph coloring. Decomposing reductions into separate gadgets is not only helpful for understanding existing reductions and proving them correct, but for designing new NP-hardness reductions.10 \nOur formula-to-graph reduction uses three types of gadgets: \n• There is a single truth gadget: a triangle with three vertices $T , F$ , and $X$ , which intuitively stand for True, False, and Other. Since these vertices are all connected, they must have different colors in any 3-coloring. For the sake of convenience, we will name those colors True, False, and Other. Thus, when we say that a node is colored True, we mean that it has the same color as vertex $T$ . \nFor each variable $a$ , the graph contains a variable gadget, which is a triangle joining two new nodes labeled $a$ and $overline { { a } }$ to node $X$ in the truth gadget. Node $a$ must be colored either True or False, and therefore node $overline { { a } }$ must be colored either False or True, respectively. \n• Finally, for each clause in $Phi$ , the graph contains a clause gadget. Each clause gadget joins three literal nodes (from the corresponding variable gadgets) to node $T$ (from the truth gadget) using five new unlabeled nodes and ten edges, as shown below. \nIn effect, each triangle in the clause gadget behaves like a “majority gate”. In any valid 3-coloring, if the two vertices to the left of the triangle have the same color, the rightmost vertex of the triangle must have the same color; on the other hand, if the two left vertices have different colors, the color of the right vertex can be chosen arbitrarily. See Figure 12.14. \nIt follows that there is no valid 3-coloring of a clause gadget where all three literal nodes are colored False. On the other hand, any coloring of the literal nodes with more than one color can be extended to a valid 3-coloring of the clause gadget. The variable gadgets force each literal node to be colored either True or False; thus, in any valid 3-coloring of the clause gadget, at least one literal node is colored True. \nThe final graph $G$ contains exactly one node $T$ , exactly one node $F$ , and exactly two nodes $a$ and $bar { a }$ for each variable. For example, Figure 12.15 shows the graph that results from the same $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula $( a lor b lor c ) land ( b lor bar { c } lor bar { d } ) land ( bar { a } lor c lor d ) land$ $( a lor bar { b } lor bar { d } )$ that we previously used to illustrate the MaxIndSet reduction in Figure 12.8. The 3-coloring is one of several that correspond to the satisfying assignment $a = c = mathrm { T R U E }$ , $b = d =$ False. \nWe’ve already done most of the work for a proof of correctness. If the formula is satisfiable, then we can color the literal nodes according to any satisfying assignment, and then (because each clause is satisfied) extend the coloring across every clause gadget. On the other hand, if the graph is 3-colorable, then we can extract a satisfying assignment from any 3-coloring—at least one of the three literal nodes in every clause gadget is colored True. \nBecause 3Color is a special case of the more general graph coloring problem— \nWhat is the minimum number of colors?—the more general optimization problem is also NP-hard. \n12.11 Hamiltonian Cycle \nA Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. (This is very different from an Euler circuit, which is a closed walk that traverses every edge exactly once; Euler circuits are easy to find and construct in linear time using depth-first search.) Here we consider two different proofs that the Hamiltonian cycle problem in directed graphs is NP-hard. \nFrom Vertex Cover \nOur first NP-hardness proof reduces from the decision version of the vertex cover problem. Given an undirected graph $G$ and an integer $k$ , we construct a directed graph $H$ , such that $H$ has a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if $G$ has a vertex cover of size $k$ . As in our previous reductions, the output graph $H$ is composed of several gadgets, each corresponding to certain features of the inputs $G$ and $k$ . \nV⌅ ↵⌅$C%&⌅ T .⌅ T .⌅   \ngraph G transform H D⇧ ⌅⇥↵⌅⇤ H*⌥C✏⇥⌃⌅ Ham. cycle H has a veortfesxizce G has a $k$ er in ${ mathrm { O } } ( V + E )$   \nk time graph F*⌃⌦⌅ F*⌃⌦⌅   \ninteger H has no G has no Ham. cycle vertex cover of size k \n• For each undirected edge $u nu$ in $G$ , the directed graph $H$ contains an edge gadget consisting of four vertices $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } )$ , $( u , nu , mathrm { o u t } )$ , $( nu , u , mathrm { i n } )$ , $( nu , u ,$ out) and six directed edges \nas shown in Figure 12.16. Each “in” vertex has an additional incoming edge, and each “out” vertex has an additional outgoing edge. Any Hamiltonian cycle in $H$ must pass through an edge gadget in one of three ways—either straight through on both sides, or with a detour from one side to the other and back. Eventually, these options will correspond to both $u$ and $nu$ , only $u$ , or only $nu$ belonging to some vertex cover. \n• For each vertex $u$ in $G$ , all the edge gadgets for incident edges $u nu$ are connected in $H$ into a single directed path, which we call a vertex chain. Specifically, suppose vertex $u$ has $d$ neighbors $nu _ { 1 } , nu _ { 2 } , ldots , nu _ { d }$ . Then $H$ has $d - 1$ additional edges $( u , nu _ { i } , mathrm { o u t } ) {  } ( u , nu _ { i + 1 } , mathrm { i n } )$ for each $i$ from 1 to $d - 1$ .",

Specifically, suppose vertex $u$ has $d$ neighbors $nu _ { 1 } , nu _ { 2 } , ldots , nu _ { d }$ . Then $H$ has $d - 1$ additional edges $( u , nu _ { i } , mathrm { o u t } ) {  } ( u , nu _ { i + 1 } , mathrm { i n } )$ for each $i$ from 1 to $d - 1$ . \n• Finally, $H$ also contains $k$ cover vertices $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , ldots , x _ { k }$ . Each cover vertex has a directed edge to the first vertex in each vertex chain, and a directed edge from the last vertex in each vertex chain. \nFigure 12.17 shows a complete example of our transformation; each doublearrowed blue segment represents a pair of directed edges. \nAs usual, we prove our reduction is correct in two stages. \n$Rightarrow$ First, suppose $C = { u _ { 1 } , u _ { 2 } , ldots , u _ { k } }$ is a vertex cover of $G$ of size $k$ . We can construct a Hamiltonian cycle in $H$ that “encodes” $C$ as follows. For each index $i$ from 1 to $k$ , we traverse a path from cover vertex $x _ { i }$ , through the vertex chain for $u _ { i }$ , to cover vertex $x _ { i + 1 }$ (or cover vertex $x _ { 1 }$ if $i = k mathrm { dot { Omega } }$ ). As we traverse the chain for each vertex $u _ { i }$ , we determine how to proceed from each node $( u _ { i } , nu , mathrm { i n } )$ as follows: \n– If $nu in C$ , follow the edge $( u _ { i } , nu , mathrm { i n } ) {  } ( u _ { i } , nu , mathrm { o u t } )$ . – If $nu not in C$ , detour through $( u _ { i } , nu , mathrm { i n } ) {  } ( nu , u _ { i } , mathrm { i n } ) {  } ( nu , u _ { i } , mathrm { o u t } ) {  } ( u _ { i } , nu , mathrm { o u t } ) .$ \nThus, for each edge $u nu$ of $G$ , the Ha\u0001miltonian\u0001cycle visits\u0001 $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } )$ and $( u , nu , mathrm { o u t } )$ as part of $u ^ { mathrm { i } }$ ’s vertex chain if $u in C$ and as part of $nu$ ’s vertex chain otherwise. See Figure 12.18. \n$Leftarrow mathrm { O n }$ the other hand, suppose $H$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle $C$ . This cycle must contain an edge from each cover vertex to the start of some vertex chain. Our case analysis of edge gadgets inductively implies that after $C$ enters the vertex chain for some vertex $u$ , it must traverse the entire vertex chain. Specifically, at each vertex $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } )$ , the cycle must contain either the single edge $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } ) {  } ( u , nu , mathrm { o u t } )$ or the detour path $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } ) {  } ( nu , u , mathrm { i n } ) {  } ( nu , u , mathrm { o u t } ) {  } ( u , nu , mathrm { o u t } )$ , f\u0001ollowed by an edge to the next edge gad\u0001get in u’s\u0001vertex chai\u0001n, or to a cover vertex if this is the last edge gadget in u’s vertex chain. In particular, if $C$ contains the detour edge $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } ) {  } ( nu , u , mathrm { i n } )$ , it cannot contain edges between any cover vertex and $nu ^ { prime } s$ vertex ch\u0001ain. It follows that $C$ traverses exactly $k$ vertex chains. Moreover, these vertex chains describe a vertex cover of the original graph $G$ , because $C$ visits the vertex $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } )$ for every edge $u nu$ in $G$ . \nWe conclude that $G$ has a vertex cover of size $k$ if and only if $H$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle. The transformation from $G$ to $H$ takes at most $O ( V ^ { 2 } )$ time; it follows that the directed Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-hard. \nFrom 3SAT \nWe can also prove that the directed Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-hard by reducing directly from $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ . Given an arbitrary $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula $Phi$ with $n$ variables $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , ldots , x _ { n }$ and $k$ clauses $c _ { 1 } , c _ { 2 } , ldots , c _ { k }$ , we construct a directed graph $H$ that contains a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if $Phi$ is satisfiable, as follows. \nFor each variable $x _ { i }$ , we construct a variable gadget, which consists of a doubly-linked list of $2 k$ vertices $( i , 0 ) , ( i , 1 ) , ldots , ( i , 2 k )$ , connected by edges $( i , j - 1 ) { to } ( i , j )$ and $( i , j ) {  } ( i , j - 1 )$ for each index $j$ . We connect the first and last nodes in each adjacent pair of variable gadgets by adding edges",

        "content": "$Leftarrow mathrm { O n }$ the other hand, suppose $H$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle $C$ . This cycle must contain an edge from each cover vertex to the start of some vertex chain. Our case analysis of edge gadgets inductively implies that after $C$ enters the vertex chain for some vertex $u$ , it must traverse the entire vertex chain. Specifically, at each vertex $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } )$ , the cycle must contain either the single edge $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } ) {  } ( u , nu , mathrm { o u t } )$ or the detour path $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } ) {  } ( nu , u , mathrm { i n } ) {  } ( nu , u , mathrm { o u t } ) {  } ( u , nu , mathrm { o u t } )$ , f\u0001ollowed by an edge to the next edge gad\u0001get in u’s\u0001vertex chai\u0001n, or to a cover vertex if this is the last edge gadget in u’s vertex chain. In particular, if $C$ contains the detour edge $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } ) {  } ( nu , u , mathrm { i n } )$ , it cannot contain edges between any cover vertex and $nu ^ { prime } s$ vertex ch\u0001ain. It follows that $C$ traverses exactly $k$ vertex chains. Moreover, these vertex chains describe a vertex cover of the original graph $G$ , because $C$ visits the vertex $( u , nu , mathrm { i n } )$ for every edge $u nu$ in $G$ . \nWe conclude that $G$ has a vertex cover of size $k$ if and only if $H$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle. The transformation from $G$ to $H$ takes at most $O ( V ^ { 2 } )$ time; it follows that the directed Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-hard. \nFrom 3SAT \nWe can also prove that the directed Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-hard by reducing directly from $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ . Given an arbitrary $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula $Phi$ with $n$ variables $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , ldots , x _ { n }$ and $k$ clauses $c _ { 1 } , c _ { 2 } , ldots , c _ { k }$ , we construct a directed graph $H$ that contains a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if $Phi$ is satisfiable, as follows. \nFor each variable $x _ { i }$ , we construct a variable gadget, which consists of a doubly-linked list of $2 k$ vertices $( i , 0 ) , ( i , 1 ) , ldots , ( i , 2 k )$ , connected by edges $( i , j - 1 ) { to } ( i , j )$ and $( i , j ) {  } ( i , j - 1 )$ for each index $j$ . We connect the first and last nodes in each adjacent pair of variable gadgets by adding edges \n\nfor each index $i$ ; we also connect the endpoints of the first and last variable gadgets with the edges \nThe resulting graph $G$ has exactly $2 ^ { n }$ Hamiltonian cycles, one for each assignment of boolean values to the $n$ variables of $Phi$ . Specifically, for each $i$ , we traverse the ith variable gadget from left to right if $x _ { i } =$ True and right to left if $x _ { i } = mathtt { F a L S E }$ . See Figure 12.19. \nNow we extend $G$ to a larger graph $H$ by adding a clause vertex $[ j ]$ for each clause $c _ { j }$ , connected to the variable gadgets by six edges, as shown in Figure 12.20. For each positive literal $x _ { i }$ in $c _ { j }$ , we add the edges $( i , 2 j - 1 ) {  } [ j ] {  } ( i , 2 j )$ , and for each negative literal $bar { x } _ { i }$ in $c _ { j }$ , we add the edges $( i , 2 j ) {  } [ j ] {  } ( i , 2 j - 1 )$ . The connections to the clause vertices guarantee that a Ha\u0001milto\u0001nian cycle in $G$ can be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle in $H$ if and only if the corresponding variable assignment satisfies $Phi$ . Exhaustive case analysis now implies that $H$ has a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if $Phi$ is satisfiable. \nTransforming the formula $Phi$ into the graph $H$ takes $O ( k n )$ time, which is at most quadratic in the total length of the formula; we conclude that the directed Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-hard. \nVariants and Extensions \nTrivial modifications of the previous reductions imply that the Hamiltonian path problem in directed graphs is also NP-hard.

In fact, there is a relatively simple reduction from the directed Hamiltonian cycle/path problem to the undirected Hamiltonian cycle/path problem; again, I’ll leave the details of this reduction as an exercise. \nFinally, the infamous traveling salesman problem asks to find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle (or path) in a graph with weighted edges. Since finding the shortest cycle/path is obviously harder than determining if a cycle/path exists at all—Consider a graph where every edge has weight 1!—TravelingSalesman is also NP-hard. \n12.12 Subset Sum (from Vertex Cover) \nThe next problem that we prove NP-hard is the SubsetSum problem considered in Chapter 2: Given a set $X$ of positive integers and an integer $T$ , determine whether $X$ has a subset whose elements sum to $T$ . \nWe once again reduce from VertexCover.

This problem can be proved NP-hard by reduction from the general circuit satisfiability problem, by replacing each crossing with a small assemblage of gates.   \n• 1-in-3Sat: Given a 3CNF formula, is there an assignment of values to the variables so that each clause contains exactly one True literal? This problem can be proved NP-hard by reduction from the usual 3Sat.   \n• NotAllEqual3Sat: Given a 3CNF formula, is there an assignment of values to the variables so that every clause contains at least one True literal and at least one False literal? This problem can be proved NP-hard by reduction from the usual $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ .   \n• Planar3Sat: Given a $3 mathrm { C N F }$ boolean formula, consider a bipartite graph whose vertices are the clauses and variables, where an edge indicates that a variable (or its negation) appears in a clause. If this graph is planar, the $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula is also called planar. The Planar3Sat problem asks, given a planar $3 mathrm { C N F }$ formula, whether it has a satisfying assignment. This problem can be proved NP-hard by reduction from PlanarCircuitSat.14   \n• Exact3DimensionalMatching or $mathbf { X _ { 3 } M }$ : Given a set $s$ and a collection of three-element subsets of $s$ , called triples, is there a sub-collection of disjoint triples that exactly cover $S ?$ This problem can be proved NP-hard by a reduction from $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ , because it has a 3 in it.   \n• Partition: Given a set $s$ of $n$ integers, are there subsets $A$ and $B$ such that $A cup B = S$ , $A cap B = emptyset$ , and $sum _ { a in A } a = sum _ { b in B } b ?$ \nThis problem can be proved NP-hard by a simple reduction from SubsetSum.   \nLike SubsetSum, the Partition problem is only weakly NP-hard. \n• 3Partition: Given a set $s$ of $3 n$ integers, can it be partitioned into n disjoint three-element subsets, such that every subset has exactly the same sum? Despite the similar names, this problem is very different from Partition; sorry, I didn’t make up the names. This problem can be proved NP-hard by reduction from $mathrm { Delta } mathrm { X } _ { 3 } mathrm { M }$ , because it has a 3 in it. Unlike Partition, the 3Partition problem is strongly NP-hard; it remains NP-hard even if every input number is at most $n ^ { 3 }$ . \n• SetCover: Given a collection of sets $pmb { S } = { S _ { 1 } , S _ { 2 } , dots , S _ { m } }$ , find the smallest sub-collection of $S _ { i }$ ’s that contains all the elements of $textstyle bigcup _ { i } S _ { i }$ . This problem is a generalization of both VertexCover and $mathrm { Delta } mathrm { X } _ { 3 } mathrm { M }$ .   \n• HittingSet: Given a collection of sets $pmb { S } = { S _ { 1 } , S _ { 2 } , dots , S _ { m } }$ , find the minimum number of elements of $textstyle bigcup _ { i } S _ { i }$ that hit every set in S. This problem is also a generalization of VertexCover.   \n• LongestPath: Given a non-negatively weighted graph $G$ (either directed or undirected) and two vertices $u$ and $nu$ , what is the longest simple path from $u$ to $nu$ in the graph? A path is simple if it visits each vertex at most once. This problem is a generalization of the corresponding Hamiltonian path problem. Of course, the corresponding shortest path problem can be solved in polynomial time.   \n• SteinerTree: Given a weighted, undirected graph $G$ with some of the vertices marked, what is the minimum-weight subtree of $G$ that contains every marked vertex? If every vertex is marked, the minimum Steiner tree is the minimum spanning tree; if exactly two vertices are marked, the minimum Steiner tree is the shortest path between them. This problem can be proved NP-hard by reduction from VertexCover.   \n• Max2Sat: Given a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form, with exactly two literals per clause, find a variable assignment that maximizes the number of clauses with at least one True literal. This problem can be proved NP-hard by reduction from 3Sat (yes, even though it doesn’t have a 3 in it). The simpler decision problem 2Sat, which asks if there is an assignment that satisfies every clause, can actually be solved in polynomial time.   \n• MaxCut: Given an undirected graph $G = ( V , E )$ , find a subset $S subset V$ that maximizes the number of edges with exactly one endpoint in $s$ . Equivalently, find the largest bipartite subgraph of $G$ . This problem can be proved NP-hard by reduction from Max2Sat. \nIn addition to these dry but useful problems, most interesting puzzles and solitaire games have been shown to be NP-hard, or to have NP-hard generalizations. (Arguably, if a game or puzzle isn’t at least NP-hard, it isn’t interesting!)

For a complete set of rules, the reader should consult Wikipedia; here a few important differences from the Anglo-American game: \n• Flying kings: As in checkers, a piece that ends a move in the row closest to the opponent becomes a king and gains the ability to move backward. Unlike in checkers, however, a king in international draughts can move any distance along a diagonal line in a single turn, as long as the intermediate squares are empty or contain exactly one opposing piece (which is captured). \n• Forced maximum capture: In each turn, the moving player must capture as many opposing pieces as possible. This is distinct from the forced-capture rule in checkers, which requires only that each player must capture if possible, and that a capturing move ends only when the moving piece cannot capture further. In other words, checkers requires capturing a locally maximal set of opposing pieces on each turn; whereas, international draughts requires a globally maximum capture. \n• Capture subtleties: As in checkers, captured pieces are removed from the board only at the end of the turn. Any piece can be captured at most once. Thus, when an opposing piece is jumped, that piece remains on the board but cannot be jumped again until the end of the turn. \nFor example, in the first position shown below, each circle represents a piece, and doubled circles represent kings. Black must make the first indicated move, capturing five white pieces, because it is not possible to capture more than five pieces, and there is no other move that captures five. Black cannot extend his capture further, either northeast or southeast, because the captured White pieces remain on the board until his turn is over. Then White must make the second indicated move, thereby winning the game. \nThe actual game, which is played on a $1 0 times 1 0$ board with 20 pieces of each color, is computationally trivial; we can precompute the optimal move for both players in every possible board configuration and hard-code the results into a lookup table of constant size. Sure, it’s a big constant, but it’s still a constant! \nBut consider the natural generalization of international draughts to an $n times n$ board. In this setting, finding a legal move is actually NP-hard! The following reduction from the Hamiltonian cycle problem in directed graphs was discovered by Bob Hearn in 2010.27 In most two-player games, finding the best move is NP-hard (or worse). This is the only example I know of a game—and moreover a real game played by millions of people for centuries—where merely following the rules is NP-hard! \nGiven an undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, we construct a board configuration for international draughts, such that White can capture a certain number of black pieces in a single move if and only if $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle. We treat $G$ as a directed graph, with two arcs $u {  } nu$ and $nu {  } u$ in place of each undirected edge $u nu$ . Number the vertices arbitraril\u0001y from 1 t\u0001o $n$ . The final draughts configuration has several gadgets: \n\n• The vertices of $G$ are represented by rabbit-shaped vertex gadgets, which are evenly spaced along a horizontal line. Each arc $i {  } j$ is represented by a path of two diagonal line segments from the “left ear\u0001” of vertex gadget $i$ to the “right ear” of vertex gadget $j$ . The path for arc $i {  } j$ is located above the vertex gadgets if $i < j$ , and below the vertex gadgets\u0001if $i > j$ . \n• The bulk of each vertex gadget is a diamond-shaped region called a vault. The walls of the vault are composed of two solid layers of black pieces, which cannot be captured; these pieces are drawn as gray circles in the figures. There are $N$ capturable black pieces inside each vault, for some large integer $N$ to be determined later. A white king can enter the vault through the “right ear”, capture every internal piece, and then exit through the “left ear”. Both ears are hallways, again with walls two pieces thick, with gaps where the arc paths end to allow the white king to enter and leave. The lengths of the “ears” can easily be adjusted to align with the other gadgets.   \n• For each arc $i {  } j$ , we have a corner gadget, which allows a white king leaving vertex gadget $i$ to be redirected to vertex gadget $j$ .   \n• Finally, wherever two arc paths cross, we have a crossing gadget; these gadgets allow the white king to traverse either arc path, but forbid switching from one arc path to the other. \nA single white king starts at the bottom corner of one of the vaults. In any legal move, this king must alternate between traversing entire arc paths and clearing vaults. The king can traverse the various gadgets backward, entering each vault through the exit and vice versa. But the reversal of a Hamiltonian cycle in $G$ is another Hamiltonian cycle in $G$ , so walking backward is fine. \n\nIf there is a Hamiltonian cycle in $G$ , the white king can capture at least nN black pieces by visiting each of the other vaults and returning to the starting vault. On the other hand, if there is no Hamiltonian cycle in $G$ , the white king can capture at most half of the pieces in the starting vault, and thus can capture at most $( n - 1 / 2 ) N + O ( n ^ { 3 } )$ enemy pieces altogether. The $O ( n ^ { 3 } )$ term accounts for the corner and crossing gadgets; each edge passes through one corner gadget and at most $n ^ { 2 } / 2$ crossing gadgets. \nTo complete the reduction, we set $N = n ^ { 4 }$ . Summing up, we obtain an $O ( n ^ { 5 } ) times O ( n ^ { 5 } )$ board configuration, with $O ( n ^ { 5 } )$ black pieces and one white king. We can clearly construct this board configuration by brute force in polynomial time. Figure 12.25 shows a complete example of the construction. \nIt is still open whether the following related question is NP-hard: Given an $n times n$ board configuration for international draughts, can (and therefore must) White capture all the black pieces (thereby winning the game) in a single turn?",

        "content": "n12.16 On Beyond Zebra \nP and NP are only the first two steps in an enormous hierarchy of complexity classes. To close this chapter (and the book), let me describe a few more classes of interest. \nPolynomial Space \nPSPACE is the set of decision problems that can be solved using polynomial space. Every problem in NP (and therefore in P) is also in PSPACE. It is generally believed that $mathrm { N P } neq mathrm { P S P A C E }$ , but nobody can even prove that $mathrm { P } neq mathrm { P S P A C E }$ . A problem $Pi$ is PSPACE-hard if, for any problem $Pi ^ { prime }$ that can be solved using polynomial space, there is a polynomial-time many-one reduction from $Pi ^ { prime }$ to $Pi$ . If any PSPACE-hard problem is in NP, then PSPACE ${ bf Lambda } = { bf N P }$ ; similarly, if any PSPACE-hard problem is in P, then PSPACE $mathsf { Lambda } = mathrm { P }$ . \nThe canonical PSPACE-hard problem is the quantified boolean formula problem, or QBF: Given a boolean formula $Phi$ that may include any number of universal or existential quantifiers, but no free variables, is $Phi$ equivalent to True? For example, the following expression is a valid input to QBF: \nSat is equivalent to the special case of QBF where the input formula contains only existential quantifiers ( ). QBF remains PSPACE-hard even when the input formula must have all its quantifiers at the beginning, the quantifiers strictly alternate between and $forall$ , and the quantified proposition is in conjunctive normal form, with exactly three literals in each clause, for example: \nThis restricted version of QBF can also be phrased as a two-player strategy question. Suppose two players, Alice and Bob, are given a 3CNF predicate with free variables $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , ldots , x _ { n }$ . The players alternately assign values to the variables in order by index—Alice assigns a value to $x _ { 1 }$ , Bob assigns a value to $x _ { 2 }$ , and so on. Alice eventually assigns values to every variable with an odd index, and Bob eventually assigns values to every variable with an even index. Alice wants to make the expression True, and Bob wants to make it False. Assuming Alice and Bob play perfectly, who wins this game? Not surprisingly, most two-player games28 like tic-tac-toe, reversi, checkers, go, chess, and mancala—or more accurately, appropriate generalizations of these constant-size games to arbitrary board sizes—are PSPACE-hard. \nAnother canonical PSPACE-hard problem is NFA totality: Given a nondeterministic finite-state automaton $M$ over some alphabet $Sigma$ , does $M$ accept every string in $Sigma ^ { * } ?$ The closely related problems NFA equivalence (Do two given NFAs accept the same language?) and NFA minimization (Find the smallest NFA that accepts the same language as a given NFA) are also PSPACE-hard, as are the corresponding questions about regular expressions. (The corresponding questions about deterministic finite-state automata are actually solvable in polynomial time.) \nExponential Time \nThe next significantly larger complexity class, EXP (also called EXPTIME), is the set of decision problems that can be solved in exponential time, that is, using at most $2 ^ { n ^ { c } }$ steps for some constant $c > 0$ . Every problem in PSPACE (and therefore in NP (and therefore in P)) is also in EXP. It is generally believed that $mathrm { P S P A C E } subsetneq mathrm { E X P }$ , but nobody can even prove that $mathrm { N P } neq mathrm { E X P }$ . A problem $Pi$ is EXP-hard if, f⊊or any problem $Pi ^ { prime }$ that can be solved in exponential time, there is a polynomial-time many-one reduction from $Pi ^ { prime }$ to $Pi$ . If any EXP-hard problem is in PSPACE, then EXP $ c =$ PSPACE; similarly, if any EXP-hard problem is in NP, then $operatorname { E X P = N P }$ . We do know that $mathrm { P } neq mathrm { E X P }$ ; in particular, no EXP-hard problem is in P.",

The boundary between PSPACEcomplete games and EXP-hard games is rather subtle. For example, there are three ways to draw in chess (the standard $8 times 8$ game): stalemate (the player to move is not in check but has no legal moves), repeating the same board position three times, or moving fifty times without capturing or moving a pawn. The $n times n$ generalization of chess is either in PSPACE or EXP-hard depending on how we generalize these rules.

For each problem, the \n\ninput is a boolean formula $Phi$ in conjunctive normal form, and the goal is to determine whether $Phi$ has a satisfying assignment. \n(a) Suppose every clause of $Phi$ contains at most three literals and each variable appears in at most three clauses.

[Hint: Solve part (a) first.]   \nn(c) Suppose every clause of $Phi$ can contain any number of literals, but each variable appears in at most two clauses. Describe a polynomial-time algorithm for this variant of CNFSat.   \nn(d) Suppose every clause of $Phi$ contains exactly three literals and each variable appears in at most three clauses.

(b) Prove that 1-in-3Sat is NP-hard. \n13. A boolean formula in exclusive-or conjunctive normal form (XCNF) is a conjunction (And) of several clauses, each of which is the exclusive-or of several literals; that is, a clause is true if and only if it contains an odd number of true literals. The XCNF-Sat problem asks whether a given XCNF formula is satisfiable. Either describe a polynomial-time algorithm for XCNF-Sat or prove that XCNF-Sat is NP-hard.

Majority3Sat asks whether there is an assignment to the variables of $Phi$ , such that every clause contains at least two True literals. \nEither describe an algorithm that solves Majority3Sat in polynomial time or prove that Majority3Sat is NP-hard.

The input is a boolean formula $Phi$ in conjunctive normal form, with exactly three literals in each clause. The problem is to decide whether there is an assignment to the variables of $Phi$ such that in each clause of $Phi$ , the number of True literals is in the set $X$ . For example: \n\n• 1,2, 3 - ${ cdot 3 } S mathrm { A T }$ is the standard $3 S _ { mathrm { A T } }$ problem. • ${ 0 , 3 }$ -3Sat is the same as AllOrNothing3Sat.

Prove that the following variants of the minimum spanning tree problem are NP-hard. \n(a) Given a graph $G$ , compute the maximum-diameter spanning tree of $G$ . (The diameter of a tree $T$ is the length of the longest path in $T$ .)   \n(b) Given a graph $G$ with weighted edges, compute the minimum-weight depth-first spanning tree of $G$ .   \n(c) Given a graph $G$ with weighted edges and a subset $s$ of vertices of $G$ , compute the minimum-weight spanning tree all of whose leaves are in $s$ .   \n(d) Given a graph $G$ with weighted edges and an integer $ell$ , compute the minimum-weight spanning tree with at most $ell$ leaves.   \n(e) Given a graph $G$ with weighted edges and an integer $Delta$ , compute the minimum-weight spanning tree where every node has degree at most $Delta$ . \n18.

Describe a direct polynomial-time reduction from 4Color to 3Color. (This is a lot harder than the opposite direction.) \n22. A domino is a $1 times 2$ rectangle divided into two squares, each of which is labeled with an integer.29 In a legal arrangement of dominos, the dominos are lined up end-to-end so that the numbers on adjacent ends match. \nFor each of the following problems, either describe a polynomial-time algorithm or prove that the problem is NP-hard: \n(a) Given an arbitrary bag $D$ of dominos, is there a legal arrangement of all the dominos in $D$ ?   \n(b) Given an arbitrary bag $D$ of dominos, is there a legal arrangement of a dominos from $D$ in which every integer between 1 and $n$ appears exactly twice? \nn(c) Given an arbitrary bag $D$ of dominos, what is the largest number of dominos we can take from $D$ to make a legal arrangement? \n23. Pebbling is a solitaire game played on an undirected graph $G$ , where each vertex has zero or more pebbles. A single pebbling move consists of removing two pebbles from a vertex $nu$ and adding one pebble to an arbitrary neighbor of $nu$ . (Obviously, the vertex $nu$ must have at least two pebbles before the move.) The PebbleDestruction problem asks, given a graph $G = left( V , E right)$ and a pebble count $p ( nu )$ for each vertex $nu$ , whether is there a sequence of pebbling moves that removes all but one pebble. Prove that PebbleDestruction is NP-hard. \n24. Recall that a 5-coloring of a graph $G$ is a function that assigns each vertex of $G$ a “color” from the set ${ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 }$ , such that for any edge $u nu$ , vertices $u$ and $nu$ are assigned different “colors”. A 5-coloring is careful if the colors assigned to adjacent vertices are not only distinct, but differ by more than 1 (mod 5). Prove that deciding whether a given graph has a careful 5-coloring is NP-hard. [Hint: Reduce from the standard 5Color problem.] \n25. (a) A subset $s$ of vertices in an undirected graph $G$ is half-independent if each vertex in $s$ is adjacent to at most one other vertex in S. Prove that finding the size of the largest half-independent set of vertices in a given undirected graph is NP-hard. (b) A subset $s$ of vertices in an undirected graph $G$ is sort-of-independent if if each vertex in $s$ is adjacent to at most 374 other vertices in S. Prove that finding the size of the largest sort-of-independent set of vertices in a given undirected graph is NP-hard. (c) A subset $s$ of vertices in an undirected graph $G$ is almost independent if at most 374 edges in $G$ have both endpoints in S. Prove that finding the size of the largest almost-independent set of vertices in a given undirected graph is NP-hard. \n26. Let $G = ( V , E )$ be a graph. A dominating set in $G$ is a subset $s$ of the vertices such that every vertex in $G$ is either in $s$ or adjacent to a vertex in $s$ . The \nDominatingSet problem asks, given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$ as input, whether $G$ contains a dominating set of size $k$ . Prove that this problem is NP-hard. \n27. A subset $s$ of vertices in an undirected graph $G$ is triangle-free if, for every triple of vertices $u , nu , w in S$ , at least one of the three edges uv, uw, vw is absent from $G$ . Prove that finding the size of the largest triangle-free subset of vertices in a given undirected graph is NP-hard. \n28. The RectangleTiling problem is defined as follows: Given one large rectangle and several smaller rectangles, determine whether the smaller rectangles can be placed inside the large rectangle with no gaps or overlaps. \n(a) Prove that RectangleTiling is NP-hard. (b) Prove that RectangleTiling is strongly NP-hard \n29. (a) A subset $B$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a Burr set if removing every vertex in $B$ from $G$ leaves a subgraph that does not contain a Hamiltonian path. Prove that finding the smallest Burr set in a given graph is NP-hard. (b) A subset $s$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a Schuyler set if removing every vertex in $s$ from $G$ leaves a subgraph that does contain a Hamiltonian path. Prove that finding the smallest Schuyler set in a given graph is NP-hard. \n\n30. (a) A tonian path in a graph $G$ is a path that goes through at least half of the vertices of $G$ . Show that determining whether a graph has a tonian path is NP-hard. (b) A tonian cycle in a graph $G$ is a cycle that goes through at least half of the vertices of $G$ . Show that determining whether a graph has a tonian cycle is NP-hard. [Hint: Use part (a). Or not.] \n31. Let $G$ be an undirected graph with weighted edges. A heavy Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle $C$ that passes through each vertex of $G$ exactly once, such that the total weight of the edges in $C$ is more than half of the total weight of all edges in $G$ . Prove that deciding whether a graph has a heavy Hamiltonian cycle is NP-hard. \n32. For each of the following problems, either describe a polynomial-time algorithm or prove that the problem is NP-hard. \n(a) A double-Eulerian tour in an undirected graph $G$ is a closed walk that traverses every edge in $G$ exactly twice. Given a graph $G$ , does $G$ have a double-Eulerian tour?   \n(b) A double-Hamiltonian tour in an undirected graph $G$ is a closed walk that visits every vertex in $G$ exactly twice. Given a graph $G$ , does $G$ have a double-Hamiltonian tour?   \n(c) A double-Hamiltonian circuit in an undirected graph $G$ is a closed walk that visits every vertex in $G$ exactly twice and traverses each edge in $G$ at most once. Given a graph $G$ , does $G$ have a double-Hamiltonian circuit?   \n(d) A triple-Eulerian tour in an undirected graph $G$ is a closed walk that traverses every edge in $G$ exactly three times. Given a graph $G$ , does $G$ have a triple-Eulerian tour? \n(e) A triple-Hamiltonian tour in an undirected graph $G$ is a closed walk that visits every vertex in $G$ exactly three times. Given a graph $G$ , does $G$ have a triple-Hamiltonian tour? \n33. This exercise asks you to prove that a certain reduction from VertexCover to SteinerTree is correct. Suppose we want to find the smallest vertex cover in a given undirected graph $G = left( V , E right)$ . We construct a new graph $H = ( V ^ { prime } , E ^ { prime } )$ as follows: \n• $V ^ { prime } = V cup E cup { z }$ • $E ^ { prime } = { nu e mid nu in V$ is an endpoint of $e in E } cup { nu z mid nu in V }$ . \nEquivalently, we construct $H$ by subdividing each edge in $G$ with a new vertex, and then connecting all the original vertices of $G$ to a new apex vertex $z$ . \nProve that $G$ has a vertex cover of size $k$ if and only if there is a subtree of $H$ with $k + left| E right| + 1$ vertices that contains every vertex in $E cup { z }$ . \n34. Consider the following solitaire game. The puzzle consists of an $n times m$ grid of squares, where each square may be empty, occupied by a red stone, or occupied by a blue stone. The goal of the puzzle is to remove some of the given stones so that the remaining stones satisfy two conditions: (1) every row contains at least one stone, and (2) no column contains stones of both colors. For some initial configurations of stones, reaching this goal is impossible. \nA solvable puzzle and one of its many solutions. \nProve that it is NP-hard to determine, given an initial configuration of red and blue stones, whether the puzzle can be solved. \n35. Each of the following games involves an $n times m$ grid of squares, where each square is either empty or occupied by a stone. In a single move, you can remove all the stones in an arbitrary column. \n(a) Prove that it is NP-hard to find the smallest subset of columns that can be cleared so that at most one stone remains in each row of the grid.   \n(b) Prove that it is NP-hard to find the largest subset of columns that can be cleared so that at least one stone remains in each row of the grid. \nn(c) Prove that it is NP-hard to determine whether any subset of columns can be cleared so that exactly one stone remains in each row of the grid. \n36. Jeff tries to make his students happy. At the beginning of class, he passes out a questionnaire that lists a number of possible course policies in areas where he is flexible. Every student is asked to respond to each possible course policy with one of “strongly favor”, “mostly neutral”, or “strongly oppose”. Each student may respond with “strongly favor” or “strongly oppose” to at most five questions. Because Jeff’s students are very understanding, each student is happy if (but only if) he or she prevails in at least one of their strong policy preferences. Either describe a polynomial-time algorithm for setting course policy to maximize the number of happy students, or show that the problem is NP-hard. \n37. You’re in charge of choreographing a musical for your local community theater, and it’s time to figure out the final pose of the big show-stopping number at the end. (“Streetcar!”) You’ve decided that each of the n cast members in the show will be positioned in a big line when the song finishes, all with their arms extended and showing off their best spirit fingers. \nThe director has declared that during the final flourish, each cast member must either point both their arms up or point both their arms down; it’s your job to figure out who points up and who points down. Moreover, the director has also given you a list of arrangements that will upset his delicate artistic temperament. Each forbidden arrangement is a subset of the cast members paired with arm positions; for example: “Marge may not point her arms up while Ned, Apu, and Smithers point their arms down.” \nProve that finding an acceptable arrangement of arm positions is NP-hard. \n38. The next time you are at a party, one of the guests will suggest everyone play a round of Three-Way Mumbletypeg, a game of skill and dexterity that requires three teams and a knife. The official Rules of Three-Way Mumbletypeg (fixed during the Holy Roman Three-Way Mumbletypeg Council in 1625) require that (1) each team must have at least one person, (2) any two people on the same team must know each other, and (3) everyone watching the game must be on one of the three teams. Of course, it will be a really fun party; nobody will want to leave. There will be several pairs of people at the party who don’t know each other. The host of the party, having heard thrilling tales of your prowess in all things algorithmic, will hand you a list of which pairs of party-goers know each other and ask you to choose the teams, while he sharpens the knife. \nEither describe and analyze a polynomial time algorithm to determine whether the party-goers can be split into three legal Three-Way Mumbletypeg teams, or prove that the problem is NP-hard. \n39. The party you are attending is going great, but now it’s time to line up for The Algorithm March (アルゴリズムこうしん)! This dance was originally developed by the Japanese comedy duo Itsumo Kokokara $( 1 ) 7 t = = 7 0 0 s$ for the children’s television show PythagoraSwitch (ピタゴラスイッチ). The Algorithm March is performed by a line of people; each person in line starts a specific sequence of movements one measure later than the person directly in front of them. Thus, the march is the dance equivalent of a musical round or canon, like “Row Row Row Your Boat” or \"Frère Jacques\". \nProper etiquette dictates that each marcher must know the person directly in front of them in line, lest a minor mistake lead to horrible embarrassment between strangers. Suppose you are given a complete list of which people at your party know each other. Prove that it is NP-hard to determine the largest number of party-goers that can participate in the Algorithm March. You may assume without loss of generality that there are no ninjas at your party. \n$triangleq { 4 0 }$ . Prove that the following problems about nondeterministic finite-state automata and regular expressions are NP-hard: \n(a) Given an NFA $M$ over the alphabet $Sigma = { 0 , 1 }$ , is there a string in $Sigma ^ { * }$ that $M$ does not accept?   \n(b) Given an acyclic NFA $M$ over the alphabet $Sigma = { boldsymbol { 0 } , boldsymbol { 1 } }$ , what is the length of the shortest string in $Sigma ^ { * }$ that $M$ does not accept?   \n(c) Given a regular expression $R$ over the alphabet $Sigma = { 0 , 1 }$ , is there a string in $Sigma ^ { * }$ that $R$ does not match?   \n(d) Given a star-free regular expression $R$ over the alphabet $Sigma = { emptyset , 1 }$ , what is the length of the shortest string in $Sigma ^ { * }$ that $R$ does not match? \n(In fact, problems (a) and (c) are PSPACE-complete; even proving that these problems are in PSPACE is nontrivial.) \n$bullet _ { 4 1 }$ . (a) Describe a polynomial-time algorithm for the following problem: Given an NFA $M$ over the alphabet $Sigma = { 0 , 1 }$ , is there a string in $Sigma ^ { * }$ that $M$ does accept? (b) Describe a polynomial-time algorithm for the following problem: Given a regular expression $R$ over the alphabet $Sigma = { emptyset , 1 }$ , is there a string in $Sigma ^ { * }$ that $R$ does match? \n(c) The complement of any regular language is another regular language. So why don’t these two algorithms, together with the NP-hardness results in Problem 40, prove that $scriptstyle mathrm { P = N P ? }$ \n42. Charon needs to ferry $n$ recently deceased people across the river Acheron into Hades. Certain pairs of these people are sworn enemies, who cannot be together on either side of the river unless Charon is also present. (If two enemies are left alone, one will steal the obol from the other’s mouth, leaving them to wander the banks of the Acheron as a ghost for all eternity. Let’s just say this is a Very Bad Thing.) The ferry can hold at most $k$ passengers at a time, including Charon, and only Charon can pilot the ferry.30 \nProve that it is NP-hard to decide whether Charon can ferry all $n$ people across the Acheron unharmed (aside from being, you know, dead). The input for Charon’s problem consists of the integers $k$ and $n$ and an $n$ -vertex graph $G$ describing the pairs of enemies. The output is either True or False. \nPlease do not write your solution in classical Latin. \nFor those few readers whose classical Latin is a little rusty, here is an English translation: \nXVIII. The Problem of the Man, the Goat, and the Wolf. \nA man needed to transfer a wolf, a goat, and a bundle of cabbage across a river. However, he found that his boat could only bear the weight of two [objects at a time, including the man]. And he had to get everything across unharmed. Tell me if you can: How they were able to cross unharmed? \nSolution. In a similar fashion [as an earlier problem], I would first take the goat across and leave the wolf and cabbage on the opposite bank. Then I would take the wolf across; leaving the wolf on shore, I would retrieve the goat and bring it back again. Then I would leave the goat and take the cabbage across. And then I would row across again and get the goat. In this way the crossing would go well, without any threat of slaughter. \nThe most likely author of the Propositiones is the prolific 8th-century English scholar Alcuin of York. The evidence for Alcuin’s authorship of this treatise is somewhat circumstantial; however, we do know from his correspondence with Charlemagne that he sent the emperor some “simple arithmetical problems for fun”. Most modern scholars believe that even if Alcuin did write the Propositiones, he did not invent all of the problems himself, but rather collected them from even earlier sources. \nSome things never change. \nIf we had an index file, we could look it up in the index file under “index file”. \n— Tegan Jovanka [Janet Fielding], “Castrovalva (Part 1)”, Doctor Who, Season 19 (January 4, 1982) \nI started with the phone book. Looking up “mensa” was not going to be easy, what with having to follow the strict alphabetizing rules that are so common nowadays. I prefer a softer, more fuzzy alphabetizing scheme, one that allows the mind to float free and “happen” upon the word. There is pride in that. The dictionary is a perfect example of over-alphabetization, with its harsh rules and every little word neatly in place. It almost makes me never want to eat again. \n— Steve Martin, “How I Joined Mensa”, The New Yorker, July 21, 1997. \nIndex \nFor some topics with multiple references, bold page numbers indicate the primary reference.
